   b. What do you think each row means? Tell me!  

2. How many orders do there appear to be?

3. How many lines are in the file?

4. Which burrito is more popular, steak or chicken?

5. Do chicken burritos more often have black beans or pinto beans?

6. Make a list of all of the CSV or TSV files in the DAT7 repo (using a single command). Think about how wildcard characters can help you with this task.

7. Count the number of occurrences of the word 'dictionary' (regardless of case) across all files in the DAT7 repo.
