The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) publicly claimed all three attacks. Additionally, during 2015 there has been a series of threats and terrorist attacks targeting writers, publishers, and others in the media, including the murder of a U.S. citizen blogger. The U.S. government assesses that the terrorist threat remains real and credible, and further attacks are possible.\nU.S. citizens traveling to or residing in Bangladesh should take precautions, remain vigilant about their personal security, and be alert to local security developments. Although U.S. government officials in Bangladesh continue to conduct official business without incident, the Embassy has imposed strict restrictions on personnel movement. U.S. government officials and their families are not permitted to be in most public places and are also prohibited from traveling on foot, motorcycle, bicycle, rickshaw, or other uncovered means on all public thoroughfares and sidewalks.

other means of transport are utilized only as a last resort, are often more expensive, and will provide you with fewer destination options.\xa0 U.S. law requires that any evacuation costs are your responsibility.\xa0 For those in financial need, the U.S. Department of State has the authority to provide crisis evacuation and repatriation loans on a reimbursable basis.\xa0 For more information, please visit the\xa0Emergencies Abroad page\xa0on our website.\nIf you live in or are traveling to storm-prone regions, prepare for hurricanes and tropical storms by organizing a kit in a waterproof container that includes a supply of bottled water, non-perishable food items, a battery-powered or hand-crank radio, any medications taken regularly, and vital documents (especially your passport and other identification).\xa0 Emergency shelters often provide only very basic resources and may have limited medical and food supplies.\xa0 NOAA\xa0and the\xa0Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) have additional tips on their websites.\nMonitor local radio, local media, and the National Weather Service to be aware of weather developments.\xa0 Minor tropical cyclones can develop into typhoons very quickly, limiting the time available for a safe evacuation.\xa0 Inform family and friends of your whereabouts and remain in close contact with your tour operator, hotel staff, transportation providers (airlines, cruise lines, etc.), and local officials for evacuation instructions during a weather emergency.\nFor further information on tropical cyclone warnings in the South Pacific region, please consult the Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Honolulu the National Weather Service's Central Pacific Hurricane Center, Fiji's regional meteorological center responsible for tropical cyclone warnings in the South Pacific region, or the Government of Australia's Bureau of Meteorology.\nFor further information:""}","[{'link': 'http://www.nws.noaa.gov/os/hurricane/resources/TropicalCyclones11.pdf', 'title': ""NOAA's Tropical Cyclones Preparedness Guide""}, {'link': 'http://www.travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies.html', 'title': 'Emergencies Abroad page'}, {'link': 'http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/prepare/ready.php', 'title': 'NOAA'}, {'link': 'http://www.ready.gov/hurricanes', 'title': 'Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)'}, {'link': 'http://www.usno.navy.mil/JTWC/', 'title': 'Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Honolulu'}, {'link': 'http://www.prh.noaa.gov/hnl/cphc/', 'title': ""National Weather Service's Central Pacific Hurricane Center""}, {'link': 'http://www.met.gov.fj/', 'title': ""Fiji's regional meteorological center""}, {'link': 'http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/', 'title': ""Government of Australia's Bureau of Meteorology""}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/', 'title': ""State Department's travel website""}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country.html', 'title': 'Country Specific Information'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'Smart Traveler Enrollment Program'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'STEP'}, {'link': 'http://www.usembassy.gov/', 'title': 'website of the U.S. embassy or consulate'}, {'link': 'http://twitter.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Twitter'}, {'link': 'http://www.facebook.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Facebook'}]","2015-12-09 23:25:02","2015-12-09 23:25:02"
