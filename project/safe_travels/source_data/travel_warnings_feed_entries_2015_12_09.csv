U.S. citizens currently in Mali are encouraged to review their personal safety and security plans to determine whether they should depart. U.S. citizens are responsible for making their own travel arrangements. From time to time, the U.S. Embassy may limit or suspend routine consular services due to security and staffing considerations. Please check the U.S. Embassy website for current information on available services. Citizens who decide to remain in Mali despite this travel warning should maintain situational awareness at all times and register their presence within Mali with the Embassy by enrolling in STEP. This replaces the Travel Warning issued on December 1, 2015.\nThe security environment in Mali remains fluid and the potential for attacks throughout the country, including in Bamako, remains. On November 20, an unknown number of heavily armed assailants stormed the Radisson Blu Hotel in Bamako using gunfire and grenades. One U.S. citizen and 18 civilians from Mali, Belgium, China, Israel, Russia, and Senegal\xa0were murdered in the attack. Violent extremist and militant elements, including al- Qaeda in the Lands of Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Ansar al-Dine, the Movement for Oneness and Jihad (MUJAO), and al-Murabitun have claimed responsibility for the attack on the Radisson Blu.\nU.S. citizens who choose to remain in Mali should remain vigilant, maintain awareness of their surroundings, and avoid public gatherings and locations frequented by foreigners, such as markets, restaurants, bars, and hotels. Follow the advice of local authorities and stay abreast of the situation through media outlets. Vary your daily routine, and travel only on main roads to the extent this is possible.\nFor further information:'}","[{'link': 'http://mali.usembassy.gov/', 'title': 'U.S. Embassy website'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'STEP'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en.html', 'title': ""State Department's travel website""}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/mali.html', 'title': 'Country Specific Information for Mali'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'Smart Traveler Enrollment Program'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'STEP'}, {'link': 'http://mali.usembassy.gov/', 'title': 'http://mali.usembassy.gov/'}, {'link': 'mailto://travel.state.gov/acsbamako@state.gov', 'title': 'acsbamako@state.gov'}, {'link': 'mailto://travel.state.gov/bamakoconsular@state.gov', 'title': 'consularbamako@state.gov'}]","2015-12-09 23:25:09","2015-12-09 23:25:09"

DRC or Congo-Kinshasa).\nU.S. citizens should avoid all but essential travel to the provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu, the provinces of Bas-Uele, Haut-Uele and Ituriz (northeastern part of the former Oriental Province) and particularly the new provinces of Tanganyika and Haut-Lomami (northeastern and central parts of the former province of Katanga), where instability and sporadic violence continues. Very poor transportation infrastructure throughout the country and poor security conditions in eastern DRC make it difficult for the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services anywhere outside of Kinshasa. This replaces the Travel Warning dated November 25, 2014.\nArmed groups, bandits, and elements of the Congolese armed forces, primarily located in the North Kivu, South Kivu, and the new provinces of Bas-Uele, Haut Uele, Tanganyika, Haut-Lomami, and the eastern part of Maniema Province, are known to kill, rape, kidnap, pillage, steal vehicles, and carry out military or paramilitary operations in which civilians can be indiscriminately targeted. Kidnapping for ransom is common, particularly in areas north and west of Goma, North Kivu. Military operations continue to target the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda throughout North and South Kivu, the Allied Democratic Forces in the Beni territory of North Kivu, and numerous other armed groups in the eastern Congo. The Lord's Resistance Army operates near the DRC’s borders with Central African Republic and the Republic of South Sudan, particularly in and around Garamba National Park.\nTravelers are frequently detained and questioned by poorly trained security forces at numerous official and unofficial roadblocks and border crossings throughout the country and especially near government buildings and installations in Kinshasa. Requests for bribes are extremely common, and security forces have occasionally injured or killed people who refuse to pay. If stopped at a roadblock, remain cautious. In the past year, several U.S. citizens have been illegally detained by government forces or robbed of their valuables while being searched.\nNational elections are scheduled to take place in November 2016. Political protests and demonstrations with the potential for violence may occur before, during, or after the election. U.S. citizens are urged to exercise caution, avoid any politically-related demonstrations or protests, and remain abreast of the security situation throughout the election period.\nDemonstrations, gatherings and even sporting events that are intended to be peaceful can become violent and turn deadly. Closely monitor local and international news from reliable sources. English-language news can be found on BBC at 92.6 FM. Radio Okapi broadcasts in French on 103.5 FM at 0700, 0800, 1200, and 1800 hours, and provides updates throughout the day. In emergencies, the Belgian Embassy operates a French-language radio broadcast system at FM 98.8.\nMany infectious diseases are endemic in the country, and outbreaks of potentially deadly infectious diseases can also occur without warning. See the Centers for Disease Control website for further information. Travelers should consult with their healthcare provider before traveling to the DRC for applicable vaccinations and malaria prophylaxis. \xa0Ensure that medical insurance includes medevac coverage.\nFor further information:""}","[{'link': 'http://www.travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/central-african-republic-travel-warning.html', 'title': 'Central African Republic'}, {'link': 'http://www.travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/republic-of-south-sudan-travel-warning.html', 'title': 'Republic of South Sudan'}, {'link': 'http://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/countries/drc/', 'title': 'Centers for Disease Control'}, {'link': 'http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/democratic-republic-of-congo', 'title': 'DRC'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/', 'title': ""State Department's travel website""}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/congo-kinshasa.html', 'title': 'Country Specific Information for Democratic Republic of the Congo'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'Smart Traveler Enrollment Program'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'STEP'}, {'link': 'http://kinshasa.usembassy.gov/', 'title': 'U.S. Embassy in the DRC'}, {'link': 'http://twitter.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Twitter'}, {'link': 'http://www.facebook.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Facebook'}]","2015-12-09 23:25:09","2015-12-09 23:25:09"

As a result, the FAA currently prohibits U.S. civil aviation from operating in or overflying Iraqi airspace with very limited exceptions. Foreign airlines operating in Iraq may cancel their operations without warning due to the security environment or other factors. Travelers should remain vigilant and reconfirm all flight schedules with their airline prior to commencing any travel. For further background information regarding FAA prohibitions on U.S. civil aviation, U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices website.\nU.S. citizens should avoid areas near the Syrian, Turkish, or Iranian borders, which are especially dangerous and not always clearly defined.\xa0 The Governments of Turkey and Iran continue to carry out military operations against insurgent groups in the mountainous regions bordering Iraq.\xa0 These operations have included troop movements and both aerial and artillery bombardments.\xa0 Extensive unmarked minefields also remain along these borders.\xa0 Border skirmishes with smugglers have become commonplace.\xa0 Unrest in Syria has resulted in large numbers of people seeking refuge in the area.\xa0 Iranian authorities previously detained, for an extended period, U.S. citizens who were hiking in the IKR in the vicinity of the Iranian border.\xa0 The resources available to the U.S. Embassy to assist U.S. citizens who venture close to or cross Iraq’s border with Iran are extremely limited.\xa0 The Department of State discourages travel in close proximity to the Iranian border.\nThe Government of Iraq has begun to take measures to improve the structural integrity of the Mosul Dam.\xa0 A dam failure could cause significant flooding and interruption of essential services from Mosul to Baghdad.\xa0 While it is impossible to accurately predict the likelihood of the dam failing, the Embassy has made contingency plans to relocate its personnel in such an event.\xa0 The Embassy recommends that U.S. citizens in Iraq, especially those who reside in the floodplain of the Tigris River, prepare their own contingency plans and stay informed of local media reports and Embassy security messages for updates.\nThe ability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens throughout Iraq, including Baghdad, is particularly limited given the security environment.\xa0 The U.S. Consulate General in Basrah cannot provide routine services such as passport applications, notary services, or Consular Reports of Birth Abroad.\xa0 U.S. citizens in need of these services in Erbil must make an appointment with the Consulate on-line, either through the Embassy's website or the website for the Consulate General in Erbil.\nU.S. citizens who choose to visit or reside in Iraq despite this Travel Warning are urged to take responsibility for their own personal security and belongings (including their U.S. passports) and should be aware that Iraqi authorities have arrested or detained U.S. citizens whose purpose of travel is not readily apparent.\xa0 Persons also have been detained for taking photographs of buildings, monuments, or other sites, especially in the International Zone in Baghdad, where photography is forbidden.\nFor more information:""}","[{'link': 'http://iraq.usembassy.gov/', 'title': 'U.S. Embassy website'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/iraq.html', 'title': 'Country Specific Information page for Iraq'}, {'link': 'http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/', 'title': 'the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices website.'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/syria-travel-warning.html', 'title': 'Syrian'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/turkey-travel-warning.html', 'title': 'Turkish'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/iran-travel-warning.html', 'title': 'Iranian'}, {'link': 'http://iraq.usembassy.gov/consular/us.html', 'title': ""Embassy's website""}, {'link': 'http://erbil.usconsulate.gov/', 'title': 'the website for the Consulate General in Erbil'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/', 'title': ""State Department's travel website""}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/iraq.html', 'title': 'Specific Information for Iraq.'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'Smart Traveler Enrollment Program'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'STEP'}, {'link': 'mailto://travel.state.gov/Baghdadacs@state.gov', 'title': 'email'}, {'link': 'http://iraq.usembassy.gov/consular/us.html', 'title': 'U.S. Embassy Baghdad’s website.'}, {'link': 'http://twitter.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Twitter'}, {'link': 'http://www.facebook.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Facebook'}]","2015-12-09 23:25:09","2015-12-09 23:25:09"

The Department of State has received reports of DPRK authorities detaining U.S. citizens without charges and not allowing them to depart the country.\xa0 North Korea has even detained several U.S. citizens who were part of organized tours.\xa0 Do not assume that joining a group tour or using a tour guide will prevent North Korean authorities from detaining you or arresting you.\xa0 Efforts by private tour operators to prevent or resolve past detentions of U.S. citizens in the DPRK have not succeeded in gaining their release.\nThe Government of North Korea has detained, arrested, and imposed extremely heavy fines on persons who violated DPRK laws, such as entering the country illegally. Travelers to North Korea must enter the DPRK with a valid passport and valid DPRK visa.\xa0 Foreign visitors to North Korea may be arrested, detained, or expelled for activities that would not be considered criminal outside North Korea, including involvement in unsanctioned religious and/or political activities (whether those activities took place inside or outside North Korea), unauthorized travel, or unauthorized interaction with the local population.\nNorth Korean security personnel may regard as espionage unsanctioned religious or political activities, unauthorized or unescorted travel inside North Korea and unauthorized attempts to speak directly to North Korean citizens.\xa0 North Korean authorities may fine or arrest travelers for exchanging currency with an unauthorized vendor, for taking unauthorized photographs, or for shopping at stores not designated for foreigners.\xa0 It is a criminal act in North Korea to show disrespect to the country's former leaders, Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung, or to the current leader, Kim Jong Un.\nDPRK customs officials will inspect USB drives, CDs, DVDs, mobile phones, tablets, laptops, or other electronic and multimedia devices brought into the country.\xa0 Internet browsing histories and cookies on travelers’ computers and other electronic devices are subject to search for banned content, including pornography or material critical of the DPRK government.\xa0 Possession of any media, either printed or electronic, criticizing the DPRK government is a criminal act.\xa0 Bringing pornography into the country is also a criminal act.Please be sure that the information contained on those devices does not violate the laws or regulations of the DPRK, as penalties for knowingly or unknowingly violating North Korea's laws may be much harsher than U.S. penalties for similar offenses.\xa0 Sentences for crimes can include years of detention in hard labor camps or death.\nIf DPRK authorities permit you to keep your cell phone upon entry into the country, please keep in mind that you have no right to privacy in North Korea and should assume your communications are monitored.\nGPS-trackers and satellite phones are not allowed.\nSince the United States does not maintain diplomatic or consular relations with the DPRK, the U.S. government has no means to provide normal consular services to U.S. citizens in North Korea.\xa0 The Embassy of Sweden, the U.S. Protecting Power in the DPRK capital of Pyongyang, provides limited consular services to U.S. citizens traveling in North Korea who are ill, injured, arrested, or who have died while there.\xa0 The U.S.-DPRK Interim Consular Agreement provides that North Korea will notify the Embassy of Sweden within four days of an arrest or detention of a U.S. citizen and will allow consular visits by the Swedish Embassy within two days after a request is made.\xa0 However, the DPRK government routinely delays or denies consular access.\nU.S. citizens who plan to travel to North Korea are strongly encouraged to contact the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, China, about their trip by enrolling in the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program.\xa0 If you enroll in this program, the State Department can keep you up to date with important safety and security announcements via email messages (though you may not have access to email while in the DPRK).\xa0 Enrollment also makes it easier for friends and family to get in touch with you via the U.S. Embassy in case of an emergency.\nU.S. citizens residing in China can contact the U.S. Embassy in Beijing directly.

An ongoing risk of kidnapping and hostage taking exists throughout Afghanistan.\nMilitant attacks throughout the country continue, with many of these attacks specifically targeting U.S. and other foreign citizens and entities.\xa0 Examples include the October 11, 2015 bombing of a Coalition convoy in Kabul using a suicide vehicle borne improvised explosive device (SVBIED), which wounded three Afghan civilians, the August 22 SVBIED attack on a convoy in Kabul that killed three U.S. citizens, and the August 17, 2015, kidnapping for ransom of a German citizen working for the German Technical Cooperation Agency (GTZ).\nRiots and civil disturbances can occur anywhere in Afghanistan, often without warning.\xa0 U.S. citizens should avoid all rallies and demonstrations.\xa0 Protests intended to be peaceful can become confrontational and escalate into violence at any point.\xa0 The size of these demonstrations has ranged from as small as 20 to as large as 3,000 people.\xa0 The issues that typically prompt demonstrations include grievances against the government or coalition forces, as well as spontaneous public expressions of social, political, and ethnic tensions.\nU.S. citizens representing foreign interests in property or contract disputes – a common problem for foreign companies doing business in Afghanistan – have reported that local parties to the disputes have threatened their lives or held them or their employees captive under extrajudicial conditions while awaiting payouts or intervention by local authorities.\xa0 U.S. citizens who find themselves in such situations should not assume that local law enforcement or the U.S. Embassy will be able to assist them in resolving such disputes or intervene on their behalf with Afghan officials.\nThe Department of State considers the threat to U.S. government personnel in Afghanistan sufficiently critical to require them to live and work under strict security restrictions.\xa0 All locations outside the U.S. Embassy and other U.S. government facilities are considered off-limits to Embassy personnel unless there is a compelling government interest in permitting such travel that outweighs the risk.\xa0 The internal security policies of the U.S. Embassy may be changed or adjusted at any time, without advance notice.\xa0 The Embassy will regularly restrict or prohibit movements by its personnel, often on short notice, for reasons such as terrorist attacks, security threats, or demonstrations.\xa0 Because of security concerns, unofficial travel to Afghanistan by U.S. government employees and their family members is also restricted, and requires prior approval from the Department of State.\nThe U.S. Embassy\'s ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Afghanistan is severely limited, particularly for those persons outside of Kabul.\xa0 U.S. citizens who choose to visit or remain in Afghanistan despite this Travel Warning are encouraged to limit nonessential travel within Afghanistan, formulate personal contingency plans, monitor the Embassy’s website, and enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) in order to obtain the most current information on travel and security within Afghanistan.\xa0 Enrollment in STEP makes it easier for the Embassy to contact U.S. citizens in case of an emergency.\xa0 U.S. citizens without Internet access may enroll directly with the U.S. Embassy.\nU.S. government-facilitated evacuations occur only when no safe, commercial alternatives exist. Evacuation assistance is provided on a cost-recovery basis, which means the traveler must reimburse the U.S. government for travel costs.\xa0 The lack of a valid U.S. passport and Afghan visa may hinder a U.S. citizen’s ability to depart the country and may slow the U.S. Embassy\'s ability to assist.\xa0 U.S. citizens in Afghanistan should ensure that they have proper and current documentation at all times. Evacuation options from Afghanistan are extremely limited due to the lack of infrastructure, geographic constraints, and other security concerns.\xa0 The U.S. government typically evacuates U.S. citizens to a safe haven, and travelers are responsible for making their own onward travel plans.\xa0 U.S. citizens should not expect to be evacuated to the United States and should always maintain medevac insurance while living or traveling abroad in case they need emergency medical evacuation back to the United States, which can be a significant expense.\xa0 For more information, see ""What the Department of State Can and Can\'t Do in a Crisis.""\nThe U.S. Embassy often receives threat information concerning U.S. citizens and U.S. interests in Afghanistan.\xa0 For the latest security information, U.S. citizens living or traveling abroad should regularly monitor the Department of State’s Consular Affairs’ website where current Worldwide Caution, Travel Alerts and Travel Warnings, and Country Specific Information for Afghanistan can be found.\xa0 Up-to-date information on security can also be obtained by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll free in the United States and Canada or, for callers in other countries, by calling a regular toll line at 1-202-501-4444.\xa0 These numbers are available 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays).\nFor further information:'}","[{'link': 'http://kabul.usembassy.gov/sa.html', 'title': 'Embassy’s website'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'Smart Traveler Enrollment Program'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/emergencies/crisis-support.html', 'title': '""What the Department of State Can and Can\'t Do in a Crisis.""'}, {'link': 'http://www.travel.state.gov/', 'title': 'Consular Affairs’ website'}, {'link': 'http://www.travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'http://www.travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings.html', 'title': 'Travel Alerts and Travel Warning'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/afghanistan.html', 'title': 'Country Specific Information for Afghanistan'}, {'link': 'http://www.travel.state.gov/', 'title': 'Consular Affairs’ website'}, {'link': 'http://www.travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'http://www.travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings.html', 'title': 'Travel Alerts and Travel Warning'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/step.html', 'title': 'STEP'}, {'link': 'mailto://travel.state.gov/KabulACS@state.gov', 'title': 'KabulACS@state.gov'}]","2015-12-09 23:25:09","2015-12-09 23:25:09"

the area of Kilifi County from Malindi north; the coastal counties of Tana River and Lamu; and northeastern Kenya, including the cities of El Wak, Wajir, Garissa, Mandera, and Liboi.\xa0 Travel to these restricted areas by any U.S. Embassy personnel must be pre-approved by appropriate Embassy offices. \xa0U.S. citizens in Kenya should always remain vigilant and be aware of their own personal security, and take appropriate precautions for travel in and to any location within the country.\nAlthough these restrictions do not apply to travelers not associated with the U.S. government, U.S. citizens in Kenya should take these restrictions into account when planning travel.\xa0 The Embassy regularly reviews the security of these areas for possible modification.\xa0 Travelers should keep informed of local developments by following local press, radio, and television reports prior to their visits.\xa0 Visitors should also consult their hosts, including U.S. and Kenyan business contacts, hotels, tour guides, and travel organizers.\nThe Embassy continues to consider carefully all U.S. government-sponsored regional conferences and trainings in Nairobi and the number of temporary duty personnel coming to the country for official purposes.\xa0 In addition, the Embassy relocated some staff to other countries in June and July of 2014 due to the security situation.\xa0 As of July 2014, the Peace Corps suspended its volunteer activities in Kenya and all Peace Corps Volunteers in Kenya departed the country due to the security situation.\nViolent and sometimes fatal criminal attacks, including armed carjackings, grenade attacks, home invasions and burglaries, and kidnappings can occur at any time and in any location, particularly in Nairobi.\xa0 U.S. citizens, including U.S. Embassy employees, have been victims of such crimes within the past year.\nU.S. citizens in Kenya should be extremely vigilant with regard to their personal security, particularly in crowded public places such as clubs, hotels, resorts, shopping centers, restaurants, bus stations, and places of worship.\xa0 U.S. citizens should also remain alert in residential areas, at schools, and at outdoor recreational events.\xa0 U.S. citizens should use commonsense precautions at all times, to include the following practices: avoid crowded transportation venues; visit only legitimate businesses and tourist areas only during daylight hours; use well-marked taxis and be sure to lock vehicle doors and keep windows up; lock all lodging doors and windows; carry minimal amounts of cash and credit cards; do not wear jewelry which attracts undue attention; know emergency phone numbers; do not resist or antagonize armed criminals; and always be aware of your surroundings.\xa0 These measures can help prevent a “wrong place, wrong time” scenario in the event of an attack as well as ensuring that your travel to Kenya is safe and enjoyable.\nFor further information:'}","[{'link': 'http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/pa/pa_4787.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/', 'title': ""State Department's travel website""}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html', 'title': 'Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts,'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country/kenya.html', 'title': 'Kenya'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country.html', 'title': ''}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'Smart Traveler Enrollment Program'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'STEP'}]","2015-12-09 23:25:09","2015-12-09 23:25:09"

The State Department nevertheless continues to warn U.S. citizens of the risks of travel to Chad. This replaces the Travel Warning issued on October 2.\nU.S. citizens already in Chad should continue to avoid all travel to border regions, particularly those areas adjacent to Chad’s eastern border and the Lake Chad region. The U.S. Embassy’s ability to provide consular services is limited in remote and rural areas. All U.S. citizens should review their personal security and have evacuation plans that can be carried out quickly. Do not rely solely on U.S. government assistance. All U.S. citizens affiliated with humanitarian relief efforts in eastern Chad should have an evacuation plan developed with the United Nations agency coordinating their work.\nViolent extremist organizations in the region, such as Boko Haram (The Islamic State in the West Africa Province) and al-Qai’da in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb, are intent on harming Westerners and Western interests and are able to cross borders easily. On June 15 and July 11, Boko Haram conducted suicide attacks in N’Djamena targeting a police station and a market. The group continues to be extremely active in Chad, targeting local security forces and civilians in the Lake Chad region. Kidnapping for ransom is also a threat in the region.\nChad’s security environment is volatile and can deteriorate unexpectedly, especially along the border areas. There are Travel Warnings for neighboring\xa0Cameroon,\xa0Central African Republic\xa0(CAR), Libya,\xa0Niger,\xa0Nigeria, and\xa0Sudan. U.S. citizens should also note there are minefields along the borders with Libya and Sudan, and that borders can close without warning.\nU.S. citizens should take steps to mitigate the risk of becoming a victim of violent crime or terrorism by being vigilant and aware of their surroundings, especially at public gatherings and locations frequented by foreigners, such as markets, restaurants, bars, and places of worship. Avoid crowds, especially those associated with car accidents, since these incidents can become confrontational. Similarly, avoid demonstrations because even peaceful assemblies can turn violent.\nAll U.S. government personnel require authorization from the U.S. Embassy to travel outside of N'Djamena, and may be subject to other restrictions, including curfews, as security situations warrant. U.S. citizens should consider taking similar precautions when making travel plans.

U.S. citizens that the level of crime and violence in Honduras remains critically high, although it has declined in the past two years.\nThis Travel Warning supersedes the Travel Warning dated March 2015 and includes additional information on crime and security in Honduras.\nCrime and violence are serious problems throughout the country.\xa0 The Government of Honduras lacks sufficient resources to properly respond to, investigate, and prosecute cases.\xa0 As a result, criminals operate with a high degree of impunity throughout Honduras.\nSince 2010, Honduras has had one of the highest murder rates in the world, and the U.S. Embassy has recorded 42 murders of U.S. citizens during the same time period, with 10 recorded since January 2014.\xa0 However, official statistics from the Honduran Observatory on National Violence show Honduras’ homicide rate has decreased to 66 per 100,000 in 2014, down from its peak of 86.5 per 100,000 in 2011, and mid-year estimates in July 2015 predict a lower rate for 2015.\nU.S. citizens are victims of crime at levels similar to those of the local population and do not appear to be targeted based on their nationality.\xa0 The Government of Honduras added additional police in areas frequented by tourists, such as the Copan Mayan ruins and Roatan.\xa0 The Honduran Government is implementing similar programs for other locations, including La Ceiba and Trujillo, and major hotels and other tourist installations have private and police security.\nTourists traveling with group tours report fewer criminal incidents.\xa0 Honduran law enforcement reports frequent highway assaults and carjackings, including remote areas of Choluteca, Olancho, Colon and Copan Departments.\xa0 Reporting indicates that these assaults are frequently executed by criminals posing as Honduran law enforcement. \xa0This criminal activity occurs frequently enough to present security challenges for anyone traveling in remote areas.\nKidnappings and extortion are common in Honduras.\xa0 Since January 2012, four cases of kidnapped U.S. citizens were reported to the U.S. Embassy and the kidnapping victims were all subsequently released after paying ransoms.\xa0 As families of kidnapping victims often pay ransoms without reporting these crimes to police out of fear of retribution, kidnapping figures may be underreported.\nTransnational criminal organizations conduct narcotics trafficking and other unlawful activities throughout the country and use violence to control drug trafficking routes and carry out criminal activity.\xa0 Other criminals, acting both individually and in gangs in Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula, and other large cities, are known to commit crimes such as murder, kidnapping, extortion, carjacking, armed robbery, rape, and other aggravated assaults.\nSexual assault is a concern in Honduras.\xa0 Most Honduran local police and medical staff do not have the capacity to properly handle evidence collection and medical care of sexual assault cases.\nRoatan & Bay Islands\nRoatan and the Bay Islands experience lower crime rates than the Honduras mainland.\xa0 The national government of Honduras, Roatan authorities, and businesses took measures in 2014 to improve tourism security.\xa0 As on the mainland, thefts, break-ins, assaults, rapes, and murders do occur, and rates are still high by international standards.\xa0 You should exercise caution, especially at night.\xa0 If staying at a hotel resort, book tours and sightseeing through the resort or reputable tour companies.\xa0 Coxen Hole on the island of Roatan should be avoided after dark.\nIf you are traveling on a cruise ship, you should take safety precautions, avoid unfamiliar areas, and take care to book only with reputable tour companies during your stopover in Honduras.\xa0 Cruise lines and port agencies work with approved tour companies to offer packages.\xa0 The port agencies at Mahogany Bay and Towne Center have worked to improve taxi service to and from the ports.\xa0 The vast majority of cruise line passengers in Honduras experience no problems, but incidents of armed robbery and carjacking have been reported.\nPrecautions While in Honduras\nBe vigilant of your surroundings at all times and in all locations, especially when entering or exiting your home/hotel, car, garage, school, and workplace.\xa0 Whenever possible, travel in groups of two or more.\xa0 Avoid wearing jewelry, carrying large sums of money, or displaying cash, ATM/credit cards, or other valuables.\xa0 Avoid walking at night in most areas of Honduras or walking alone on beaches, in historic ruins, and on trails.\xa0 Several U.S. citizens have reported being robbed while walking on isolated beaches.\xa0 Motorists should avoid traveling between cities at night and always drive with the doors locked and windows up to deter potential robberies at traffic lights and on congested downtown streets.\xa0 Arriving U.S. citizens are strongly urged to exercise caution in discussing travel plans in public since criminals may conduct crimes based on tips from sources at airport arrival areas.\nThe location and timing of criminal activity is unpredictable in Honduras.\xa0 All travelers should exercise caution when traveling anywhere in the country; however, certain areas of the country demonstrate higher levels of criminal activity than others.\xa0 Most of Honduras’ major cities (Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula, La Ceiba, and others), as well as several Honduran “departments” (a geographic designation similar to U.S. states) have homicide rates higher than the national average for 2014, including:\nDEPARTMENT \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0CAPITAL\nAtlántida \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0

and police or military presence is scarce.\xa0 The U.S. Embassy has restricted U.S. government personnel travel to Gracias a Dios due to credible threat information against U.S citizens by criminal and drug trafficking organizations.\xa0 U.S. citizens traveling to Gracias a Dios should consider postponing their travel.\xa0 Those who choose to travel or currently reside in Gracias a Dios should

Separatist and terrorist groups continue to conduct bombings, kidnappings and attacks against civilians, political leaders, and Philippine security forces. Over the past nine months, at least 15 separate kidnappings have been reported across Mindanao. In western Mindanao, terrorist, insurgent, and criminal gangs regularly conduct kidnappings for ransom, including the kidnapping of a foreigner in Dipolog City in early October 2015 by unknown assailants. In central Mindanao, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) remain active in the Cotabato City area, and in the Maguindanao, North Cotabato, and Sultan Kudarat provinces, where the government maintains a state of emergency and a greater police presence. While there have been no recent reported terrorist threats or incidents within the Davao City or Surigao city limits, eastern Mindanao is not free from threats. In September 2015, assailants believed to be members of the Abu Sayyaf Group kidnapped four individuals from the popular resort island of Samal, a 15 minute boat ride from Davao City. Two other individuals narrowly escaped kidnapping in the same incident. There have been no reports of U.S. citizens in Mindanao targeted specifically for their nationality; however, general threats to U.S. citizens and other foreigners throughout Mindanao remain a concern.\nAlthough U.S. government officials in the Philippines travel to Mindanao for official business without incident, the Embassy has imposed a strict restriction on all but the most essential travel to the area, and Embassy employees must receive special authorization from Embassy security officials to travel to any location in Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago.\nWe strongly recommend that U.S. citizens traveling to or residing in the Philippines enroll in the Department of State’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP). STEP enrollment gives you the latest security updates, and makes it easier for the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate to contact you in an emergency. If you don’t have Internet access, enroll directly with the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.\nRegularly monitor the State Department's website, where you can find current Travel Warnings, Travel Alerts, and the Worldwide Caution.

The decision to allow the return of eligible family members and non-emergency personnel has been made because of improved civil conditions which include the reopening of the airport and the resumption of commercial flights to and from the country. The transnational military and police forces also appear to be, again, firmly in control; and the transitional Government President, Michel Kafando, has been reinstated. This Travel Warning replaces the Travel Warning issued on September 21, 2015.\nThis Travel Warning is being issued to notify U.S. citizens that on September 21, the Department of State authorized the voluntary departure of eligible family members and non-emergency personnel from the U.S. Embassy in Ouagadougou. U.S. citizens are urged to carefully consider the risks of travel to Burkina Faso and, if already in Burkina Faso, encouraged to review their and their families’ personal safety and security plans to determine whether they and their family members, should depart. U.S. citizens are responsible for making their own travel arrangements. Citizens who decide to remain in Burkina Faso despite this travel warning should maintain situational awareness at all times and register their presence within Burkina Faso with the Embassy by enrolling in STEP. This Travel Warning supersedes and replaces the Travel Alert issued on September 4, 2015.\nEmbassy staff remaining in Burkina Faso continues to shelter in place. The U.S. Embassy in Ouagadougou will operate at reduced staffing levels and will continue to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens.\nElements of the Presidential Security Regiment (RSP) took control of the presidential palace during the weekly council of ministers meeting the afternoon of September 16, detaining President Kafando, Prime Minister Zida, and two additional members of the cabinet of ministers. President Kafando and others have since been released, but Kafando remains under house arrest. Prime Minister Zida remains in detention. Former special chief of staff responsible for the RSP General Gilbert Diendere was declared to be in charge of Burkina Faso following the establishment of a “Conseil national pour la democratie” (CND, the National Council for Democracy).\nThe security environment in Ouagadougou remains fluid. Gunfire continues to be reported in locations throughout Ouagadougou. Elements of the RSP have set road blocks and have engaged in crowd control measures. Civilians have also established roadblocks around the city. The level of activity on the street has diminished, and many businesses providing essential services—including food, gasoline and cooking fuel—remain closed. Local electricity and water utility providers have declared a strike, which could further decrease the level of services provided to residents. A nationwide curfew remains in place from 7:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.\nOutside of Ouagadougou, the security situation varies, but remains dynamic and susceptible to change at any moment. There have been reports of demonstrations in Bobo-Dioulasso, Gaoua, Fada N’Gourma, and Ouahigouya. Due to reports that roadways between major cities may be impassable, U.S. citizens in Burkina Faso may find that at times sheltering in place may be the only and best security option.\nU.S. citizens who choose to remain in Burkina Faso should remain vigilant and utilize appropriate personal security practices. Avoid large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations; maintain situational awareness and exercise good judgment; be alert and remain aware of your surroundings; and stay abreast of the situation through media outlets.\nFor further information:'}","[{'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/', 'title': ""State Department's travel website""}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country.html', 'title': 'Country Specific Information for Burkina Faso'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'Smart Traveler Enrollment Program'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'STEP'}, {'link': 'http://ouagadougou.usembassy.gov/', 'title': 'U.S. Embassy Ouagadougou'}]","2015-12-09 23:25:09","2015-12-09 23:25:09"

The overall effect of the initial earthquake and its aftershocks varied greatly across the country. Areas close to the epicenters suffered significant damage, while other areas in the country were nearly unaffected. This replaces the Travel Warning dated July 2, 2015.\nThe April 25 earthquake and its aftershocks destabilized steep, mountainous areas, and severe landslides have occurred in some affected areas. Monsoon rains, which began in June and largely ended in September, may have further destabilized these areas. Although trekking permits are being issued, not all trekking areas are safe for travel. Many roads close to trekking areas are blocked and impassable. We encourage travelers to consult carefully with their travel and trekking agencies for current, location-specific information and to heed warnings of potential danger. These conditions affect the possibility of emergency assistance if needed. We recommend providing family or friends with a detailed itinerary prior to trekking. Do not trek alone.\nSporadic demonstrations and civil unrest in the Terai region of Nepal may affect tourist travel to the southern region, including Chitwan National Park and Lumbini. Peaceful demonstrations can become violent. Curfews are in effect in some places.\nVarious commodities, including fuel, have become scarce because of a marked reduction of importation. The Government of Nepal has instituted measures to ration and reduce the use of motor vehicle fuel. There are long lines for fuel at gas stations in Kathmandu, Pokhara, and rural areas. This shortage could disrupt public transportation around Nepal. Food, along with the provision of normal goods and services, might also be affected.\nFor more information:'}","[{'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/', 'title': ""State Department's travel website""}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/nepal.html', 'title': 'Specific Information for Nepal'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'Smart Traveler Enrollment Program'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'STEP'}, {'link': 'mailto://travel.state.gov/ConsKTM@state.gov', 'title': 'ConsKTM@state.gov'}, {'link': 'http://nepal.usembassy.gov/mfe.html', 'title': 'Travel Information and Messages'}, {'link': 'http://twitter.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Twitter'}, {'link': 'http://www.facebook.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Facebook'}]","2015-12-09 23:25:09","2015-12-09 23:25:09"
"http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/somalia-travel-warning.html","Somalia Travel Warning","2015-10-02 02:16:00","SO","{'value': 'The U.S. Department of State continues to warn U.S. citizens to avoid all travel to Somalia.\nThis replaces the Travel Warning dated October 24, 2014, to update information on security concerns.\nThere is no U.S. Embassy or other formal U.S. diplomatic facility in Somalia at this time. Consequently, the U.S. government is not in a position to assist or effectively provide services to U.S. citizens in Somalia. In light of this and continuous security threats, the U.S. government recommends that U.S. citizens avoid all travel to Somalia.\nThe security situation in Somalia remains unstable and dangerous. Terrorist operatives and armed groups in Somalia continue to attack Somali authorities, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), and other non-military targets. Kidnapping, bombings, murder, illegal roadblocks, banditry, and other violent incidents and threats to U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals can occur in any region of Somalia. In addition, there is a particular threat to foreigners in places where large crowds gather and Westerners frequent, including airports, government buildings, and shopping areas. Inter-clan and inter-factional fighting can flare up with little or no warning.\nWhile some parts of south/central Somalia are now under Somali government control with the military support of African Union forces, al-Shabaab, an Al-Qaida affiliate, has demonstrated the capability to carry out attacks in government-controlled territory with particular emphasis on targeting government facilities, foreign delegations’ facilities and movements, and commercial establishments frequented by government officials, foreign nationals, and the Somali diaspora. In February 2012, al-Shabaab announced that it had merged with Al-Qaida.\nAl-Shabaab-planned assassinations, suicide bombings, and indiscriminate armed attacks in civilian populated areas are frequent in Somalia. On December 25, 2014, al-Shabaab conducted an attack within the Mogadishu International Airport secure perimeter resulting in the deaths of at least eight individuals, including one U.S. citizen. Al-Shabaab remains intent on conducting attacks at popular restaurants, hotels, and convoys. This year, there have been at least four prominent hotel attacks located in the heart of the Somali capital. One U.S. citizen was killed in those attacks. Separately, in late April, a car bomb detonated adjacent to a favorite eatery frequented by government ministries and presidential palace officials. In late-June, a car bomb targeted United Arab Emirates military instructors near a military hospital, killing at least three Somali soldiers. Additionally, in January, a suicide car bomber killed at least six people in a strike apparently aimed at a Turkish government convey the day before that country’s president was to arrive in Somalia.\nKidnappings remain a daily threat in Somalia – to include Somaliland and Puntland - in addition to larger assaults, assassinations, and grenade attacks. Beyond the high profile attacks noted above, al-Shabaab has also claimed responsibility for other regional terrorist attacks.\nPirates and other criminals have specifically targeted and kidnapped foreigners working in Somalia. In January 2012, a U.S. citizen was kidnapped while on work-related travel in Somalia and in October 2011, a U.S. citizen aid worker living in Somalia was also kidnapped. In both cases, as well as in recent kidnappings of other Westerners, the victims took precautionary measures by hiring local security personnel, but those hired to protect them may have played a role in the abductions. A strong familiarity with Somalia and/or extensive prior travel to the region does not reduce travel risk. U.S. citizens considering travel to Somalia, including Somaliland and Puntland, are advised to obtain kidnap and recovery insurance, as well as medical evacuation insurance, prior to travel.\nAdditionally, U.S. citizens are urged to avoid sailing near the coast of Somalia as attacks have occurred as far as 1,000 nautical miles off the coast in international waters. Merchant vessels, fishing boats, and recreational craft all risk seizure by pirates and having their crews held for ransom in the waters off the Horn of Africa, especially in the international waters near Somalia. Somali pirates captured and killed four U.S. citizens aboard their boat on February 22, 2011. If transit around the Horn of Africa is necessary, it is strongly recommended that vessels travel in convoys, maintain good communications contact at all times, and follow the guidance provided by the Maritime Security Center – Horn of Africa (MSC-HOA). You should consult the Maritime Administration’s Horn of Africa Piracy page for information on maritime advisories, self-protection measures, and naval forces in the region.\nThe United States continues to be concerned about the risks to U.S. civil aviation operating in the territory and airspace of Somalia due to the hazards associated with terrorist and militant activity. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has prohibited U.S. civil aviation from flying below flight level (FL) 260 in the territory and airspace of Somalia. For additional background information regarding FAA flight prohibitions and advisories for U.S. civil aviation, U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices.\nFor further information:'}","[{'link': 'http://www.marad.dot.gov/news_room_landing_page/horn_of_africa_piracy/horn_of_africa_piracy.htm', 'title': 'Horn of Africa Piracy page'}, {'link': 'http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/', 'title': 'Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/', 'title': ""State Department's travel website""}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/somalia.html', 'title': 'Country Specific Information for Somalia'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP'}, {'link': 'http://twitter.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Twitter'}, {'link': 'http://www.facebook.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Facebook'}]","2015-12-09 23:25:09","2015-12-09 23:25:09"

Because of the security situation in country, the U.S. Embassy’s ability to provide consular services in remote and rural areas is extremely limited. This replaces the Travel Warning of August 5, 2015 to emphasize the continuing threat of armed attacks, bombings and kidnappings in the Far North region of Cameroon and Boko Haram’s aspirations to extend the threat to other parts of the country\nThe Boko Haram terrorist group is active in the Far North region, and has actively targeted foreign residents, tourists, and government leaders. Boko Haram’s leaders have stated and demonstrated through their actions that they are actively seeking to kidnap westerners, which may place U.S. citizens traveling to or living in the Far North and North regions of Cameroon at risk. Twenty-one foreigners have been reported kidnapped since 2013. The U.S. Embassy continues to maintain restrictions on travel by U.S. official personnel to the North, Far North, and now the East Region of Cameroon, as well as any travel north of Ngaoundere in the Adamawa Region.\nU.S. citizens should exercise extreme caution when traveling within 60 miles/100 kilometers of the border with Nigeria’s Adamawa State in the North and Adamawa Regions of Cameroon, the border area with Chad, and the border areas with CAR. Violence, banditry, and military operations in border areas can quickly spill over into Cameroon. Note there are Travel Warnings for neighboring Nigeria, Chad, and Central African Republic (CAR). The threat of piracy is present in the waters of the Bakassi peninsula in the Gulf of Guinea.\nCriminal activity continues to be a major concern particularly in Yaounde, Douala, and other towns. Burglaries, armed robberies, theft by intimidation, and snatch-and-grab crimes are commonplace in these areas. High unemployment and an under-equipped police force exacerbate the situation. An influx of refugees fleeing conflict in CAR and Nigeria has strained Cameroon’s economy and added population to already crowded urban areas.

There have been multiple Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) directed and inspired attacks on mosques in the past four months. The latest, in the city of Abha on August 6, targeted members of the Saudi security forces. Furthermore, there are ongoing security concerns related to the crisis in Yemen, particularly border incursions and missile attacks across the Saudi-Yemeni border by forces within Yemen. This replaces the Travel Warning issued February 24, 2015.\nU.S. government personnel and their families are restricted from traveling within 50 miles of the Yemeni border, and to the cities of Jizan and Najran, without permission from U.S. Embassy security officials. U.S. government personnel are also prohibited from traveling to the city of Qatif in the Eastern Province and its surrounding suburbs, including Awamiyah, and to the Al Hasa Governorate due to violent episodes that have occurred there in the past.\nSecurity threats continue and terrorist groups, some affiliated with ISIL or Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), have targeted both Saudi and Western interests. Possible targets include housing compounds, hotels, restaurants, shopping areas, international schools, and other facilities where Westerners congregate, as well as Saudi government facilities and economic/commercial targets within the Kingdom. Consular services at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates were canceled March 15-19, 2015 due to heightened security concerns at our diplomatic facilities in the Kingdom.\nMultiple attacks on mosques, as well as additional places where Shia gather,\xa0have occurred in Saudi Arabia over the past four months, resulting in significant loss of life. On May 22, 2015 a suicide bomber attacked a mosque in Al-Qadeeh in Al Qatif Governorate. On August 6, 2015 a mosque in the city of Abha was bombed. Most of the victims in that attack were members of the Saudi security forces. On May 29, 2015 a blast occurred at another mosque in the Al Anoud district of Dammam.\nU.S. citizens have been the targets of recent attacks in the Kingdom.

One was killed and the other wounded.\nThere have been several attacks on other nationalities during the past year. On November 29, 2014, a Canadian national was assaulted by a lone attacker with a cleaver at a shopping mall in Dhahran. On November 22, 2014, a Danish national was shot and injured in Riyadh by alleged ISIL supporters. On November 3, 2014, armed assailants attacked a community center in Dalwah in the Al Hasa Governorate, killing at least seven people and injuring several others. ISIL claimed responsibility for the attack.\nThe U.S. Embassy continues to receive reports of violence near the border with Yemen, including reports of small arms fire, bombs, artillery, and missile impacts. Media and independent sources report armed groups crossing the border into Saudi Arabia to conduct attacks on Saudi Arabian territory, primarily near western border cities, including Najran. The rugged border area dividing Yemen and Saudi Arabia remains porous in some areas and boundaries are not clearly defined. As the conflict continues in Yemen, violence can spill across the border at unpredictable times and locations. Forces hostile to Saudi Arabia within Yemen have weapons systems including mortars, artillery, and missiles that have been launched at targets in Saudi Arabia. On June 6, 2015, a missile was shot down 50 miles inside Saudi Arabia by Saudi forces that may have been targeting the King Khalid Air Base near Khamis Mushait. On August 26, 2015, a missile was fired across the border near Jizan and was intercepted by Saudi military. There is an increased possibility of strikes within 50 miles of the border, which could result in civilian deaths.\nVisitors who choose to travel to these areas despite U.S. government concerns should be aware that, in addition to the above noted border attacks, terrorist and criminal elements may be operating there, including AQAP. U.S. citizens are strongly urged to read the Department of State Travel Warning for Yemen before traveling to areas near the Yemeni frontier.\nU.S. citizens in Saudi Arabia are strongly encouraged to select hotels or housing compounds with careful attention to security measures and location. U.S. citizens should be aware of their surroundings at all times and are advised to keep a low profile; vary times and routes of travel; exercise caution while driving, and entering or exiting vehicles; and ensure that travel documents and visas are current and valid.\nIf the security threat changes or specific threats affecting U.S. citizens are discovered, this information will be made available through the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) and U.S. Mission websites. Emergency Messages, Security Messages, and Messages for U.S. Citizens can be found on the U.S. Embassy Riyadh website.\nFor further information:\nU.S. Embassy RiyadhTelephone: (966) (11) 488-3800Fax: (966) (11) 483-0773Emergency after-hours telephone: (966) (11) 488-3800\nU.S. Consulate General DhahranTelephone: (966) (13) 330-3200Fax: (966) (13) 330-0464Emergency after-hours telephone: (966) (13) 330-3200\nU.S. Consulate General JeddahTelephone: (966) (12) 667-0080Fax: (966) (12) 669-3098Emergency after-hours telephone: (966) (12) 667-0080'}","[{'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/yemen-travel-warning.html', 'title': 'Travel Warning for Yemen'}, {'link': 'http://riyadh.usembassy.gov/', 'title': 'U.S. Embassy Riyadh website.'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/', 'title': ""State Department's travel website""}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/saudi-arabia.html', 'title': 'Saudi Arabia Country Specific Information'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'Smart Traveler Enrollment Program'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'STEP'}, {'link': 'http://twitter.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Twitter'}, {'link': 'http://www.facebook.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Facebook'}, {'link': 'http://riyadh.usembassy.gov/', 'title': 'U.S. Embassy Riyadh'}, {'link': 'http://dhahran.usconsulate.gov/', 'title': 'U.S. Consulate General Dhahran'}, {'link': 'http://jeddah.usconsulate.gov/', 'title': 'U.S. Consulate General Jeddah'}]","2015-12-09 23:25:09","2015-12-09 23:25:09"
"http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/venezuela-travel-warning.html","Venezuela Travel Warning","2015-09-19 01:55:00","VE","{'value': 'The Department of State has issued this Travel Warning to inform U.S. citizens about security conditions in Venezuela.\nThousands of U.S. citizens safely visit Venezuela each year for study, tourism, business, and volunteer work. While U.S. citizens are not specifically targeted, violent crime in Venezuela is pervasive, both in the capital, Caracas, and in the interior. This replaces the Travel Warning issued on December 11, 2014 to include updated crime data.\nArmed robberies take place throughout Caracas and other cities, including in areas generally presumed safe and frequented by tourists. Street crime can take place at any time, and upscale residential areas where many U.S. citizens live and visit are not immune from street crime and home invasion robberies. Recently, heavily armed criminals used grenades and assault rifles to commit crimes at banks, shopping malls, public transportation stations, and universities.\nAccording to the non-governmental organization Venezuelan Violence Observatory (VVO), Venezuela has the second highest homicide rate in the world. Kidnappings are also a serious concern throughout the country, and, according to police sources, roughly 80 percent go unreported. Most can be classified as “express kidnappings” which last only a few hours, while the victim and/or family members gather as much money as possible for a quick release. Victims are often physically roughed up or even killed if they resist kidnappers’ demands. In addition, there is cross-border violence, kidnappings, drug trafficking, and smuggling along Venezuela’s western border with Colombia.\nThe Department of State considers the criminal threat to U.S. government personnel in Venezuela sufficiently serious to require them to live and work under strict security restrictions. All U.S. direct-hire personnel and their families assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Caracas are subject to an embassy movement policy for their safety and well-being. The details of the policy are found in our Country Specific Information on Venezuela. These practices limit, and may occasionally prevent, access by U.S. Embassy officials to certain areas of Caracas and the interior of the country.\nIn addition, all U.S. direct-hire personnel and their family members who are assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Caracas are required to take an armored vehicle when traveling to and from the Maiquetia Airport as well as when traveling in some parts of Caracas and the interior.\nU.S. citizens in Venezuela should be vigilant of their surroundings at all times and in all locations, especially when entering or exiting their homes, hotels, cars, garages, schools, and workplaces. Whenever possible, U.S. citizens should travel in groups of two or more persons; avoid wearing jewelry and carrying large sums of money or displaying cash, ATM/credit cards, mobile phones, or other valuables; and avoid walking at night in most areas of Venezuela and walking alone on beaches, historic ruins, and trails. Incidents of crime along inter-city roads, including carjacking and kidnapping, are common in Venezuela. Motorists should avoid traveling at night and always drive with their doors locked to deter potential robberies at traffic lights and on congested city streets.\nFor further information:'}","[{'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/venezuela.html', 'title': 'Country Specific Information on Venezuela'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/', 'title': ""State Department's travel website""}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/venezuela.html', 'title': 'Venezuela Specific Information'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP'}, {'link': 'http://twitter.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Twitter'}, {'link': 'http://www.facebook.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Facebook'}]","2015-12-09 23:25:09","2015-12-09 23:25:09"
"http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/libya-travel-warning.html","Libya Travel Warning","2015-09-16 23:54:00","LY","{'value': 'The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against all travel to Libya and recommends that U.S. citizens currently in Libya depart immediately.\nOn July 26, 2014, the U.S. Embassy suspended all embassy operations in Libya and relocated staff outside of the country because of ongoing violence between Libyan militias in the immediate vicinity of the Embassy. The security situation in Libya remains unpredictable and unstable. If in Libya, make contingency emergency plans and maintain security awareness at all times. This Travel Warning supersedes the Travel Warning issued on January 20, 2015.\nPlease direct inquiries regarding U.S. citizens in Libya to LibyaEmergencyUSC@state.gov. Callers in the United States and Canada may dial the toll free number 1-888-407-4747. Callers outside the United States and Canada may dial 1-202-501-4444.\nRecent worldwide terrorism alerts, including the Department of State’s Worldwide Caution, have stated that extremist groups continue to plan terrorist attacks against U.S. interests in the Middle East region, including Libya.\nThe Libyan government has not been able to build its military and police forces and improve security following the 2011 revolution. Many military-grade weapons remain in the hands of private individuals, U.S. and UN-designated terrorists, and other armed groups, including antiaircraft weapons that may be used against civilian aviation. Crime levels remain high in many parts of the country. In addition to the threat of crime, the threat of kidnapping is high and various groups have called for attacks against U.S. citizens and U.S. interests in Libya.\nThe internationally recognized House of Representatives has relocated to Tobruk, and its government is based in Bayda. Government authorities lack control over much of the country. Tripoli and its environs are controlled by a coalition of militias known as Operation Dawn, and affiliated authorities calling themselves the “National Salvation Government.”\nClashes are ongoing throughout the country and attacks by armed groups can occur nationwide. Hotels frequented by westerners have been caught in the crossfire. Tripoli and other urban areas have witnessed fighting between armed groups and government forces as well as terrorist attacks. Checkpoints controlled by militias are common outside of Tripoli, as well as inside the capital at times. Most international airports are closed, and flights out of operational airports are sporadic and may be cancelled without warning. The United States is very concerned about the targeting of commercial transportation in Libya. The U.S. government prohibits U.S. commercial aviation operations within Libyan airspace.\nAlong with airports, seaports and roads can close with little or no warning. The escalation of violence in Libya against civilian commercial interests raises serious concerns about the safety of maritime vessels and their crew. U.S. mariners are advised to exercise extreme caution while transiting in or near Libyan territorial waters. The Libyan National Army announced on January 7, 2015 that all vessels in Libyan waters require army approval for transit, following the January 4, 2015 bombing of a Greek-operated oil tanker that killed two crewmen near Derna, Libya. Vessels are advised to proceed with extreme caution when approaching all Libyan oil terminals and ports and are encouraged to adhere to the recommendations in the U.S. Coast Guard’s Port Security Advisory 1-14 issued April 1, 2014. Mariners planning travel to Libya should check the U.S. Coast Guard Homeport Website for any Port Security Advisory Updates and the NGA Broadcast Warnings Website (select “Broadcast Warnings”) for any special warnings or Maritime Administration Advisories before arrival.\nViolent extremist activity in Libya remains high, and violent extremist groups in Libya have made several specific threats against U.S. government officials, citizens, and interests in Libya. On January 27, 2015, the Corinthia hotel in Tripoli was attacked by a group affiliated with ISIL claiming responsibility, resulting in the death of nine individuals including five foreigners, one of whom was a U.S. citizen. Because of the presumption that foreigners, especially U.S. citizens, in Libya may be associated with the U.S. government or U.S. NGOs, travelers should be aware that they may be targeted by violent extremist groups seeking to injure, kidnap or kill U.S. citizens, and should act accordingly with extreme caution. Sporadic episodes of civil unrest have occurred throughout the country and attacks by armed militants can occur in many different areas; hotels frequented by westerners have been caught in the crossfire.\nVarious militias have supplanted the police in maintaining internal security. Militia members operate checkpoints within and between major cities. Libyan militia members are poorly trained and may be unaffiliated with the interim government, which has not yet reconstituted the national army and police. There are frequent reports of violent (and sometimes fatal) clashes between rival militias and occasional reports of vigilante revenge killings. Militia groups sometimes detain travelers for arbitrary or unclear reasons, without access to a lawyer or legal process, and without allowing detainees to inform others of their status. The State Department advises carrying proof of citizenship and valid immigration status at all times, but notes that these documents do not guarantee fair treatment. The State Department has extremely limited capacity to assist U.S. citizens who are detained by militia groups.\nU.S. citizens should avoid areas of demonstrations and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations, as even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.\nIf travel in desert and border regions of Libya is critically necessary, exercise caution and comply with local regulations. Terrorist organizations, including ISIL affiliated groups and al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, continue to threaten the region. Recent terrorist attacks have occurred in the border region, where extremists have kidnapped Westerners.

U.S. citizens seeking to depart southeastern Turkey are responsible for making their own travel arrangements. There are no plans for charter flights or other U.S. government-sponsored evacuations; however, commercial flights are readily available and airports are functioning normally. The U.S. Consulate in Adana will continue to operate normally and provide consular services to U.S. citizens.\nU.S. government employees continue to be subject to travel restrictions in southeastern Turkey. They must obtain advance approval prior to official or unofficial travel to the provinces of Hatay, Kilis, Gaziantep, Sanliurfa, Sirnak, Diyarbakir, Van, Siirt, Mus, Mardin, Batman, Bingol, Tunceli, Hakkari, Bitlis, and Elazig.\xa0The Embassy strongly recommends that U.S. citizens avoid areas in close proximity to the Syrian border.\nU.S. citizens traveling to or residing in Turkey should be alert to the potential for violence.

"http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/pakistan-travel-warning.html","Pakistan Travel Warning","2015-08-28 21:44:00","PK","{'value': ""The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against all non-essential travel to Pakistan.\nThis Travel Warning replaces the Travel Warning dated February 24, 2015, to remind U.S. citizens of ongoing security concerns in Pakistan.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Islamabad and the U.S. Consulate General in Karachi continue to provide consular services for all U.S. citizens in Pakistan.\xa0The U.S. Consulate General in Peshawar no longer offers consular services, and consular services at the U.S. Consulate General in Lahore remain temporarily suspended.\nThe presence of several foreign and indigenous terrorist groups continues to pose a danger to U.S. citizens throughout Pakistan. Across the country, terrorist attacks frequently occur against civilian, government, and foreign targets. Attacks range from targeted killings and kidnappings, to armed assaults against heavily guarded facilities, including Pakistani military installations and airports. The Government of Pakistan maintains heightened security measures, particularly in the major cities, and these measures may vary from day to day. Threat reporting indicates terrorist groups continue to seek opportunities to attack locations where U.S. citizens and Westerners are known to congregate or visit. Terrorists and criminal groups regularly resort to kidnapping for ransom.\nProtests due to domestic events and against the United States are not uncommon in Pakistan and have the potential to turn violent. Even when violent protests do not target U.S. citizens, they may result in harm to bystanders. U.S. citizens in Pakistan are strongly advised to avoid all protests and large gatherings. Rallies, demonstrations, and processions occur regularly throughout Pakistan on very short notice. Demonstrations might take on an anti-U.S. or anti-Western character, and U.S. citizens are urged to avoid large gatherings. In January 2015, protests against the French Charlie Hebdo magazine were staged in many Pakistani cities, including outside the French Consulate in Karachi, after the magazine’s office in Paris was attacked by gunmen angered by cartoons believed to be anti-Islamic. The Mission reminds U.S. citizens that even peaceful demonstrations might become violent and advises U.S. citizens to avoid demonstrations. Given multiple demands for resources, local authorities may have limited capacity to respond to requests for assistance.\nRECENT ATTACKS\nSo far in 2015, there have been more than 200 terror-related incidents in Pakistan. On August 16, a senior Punjab state official and 18 others were killed by a suicide bomber at his political office in Attock. A Pakistani Taliban splinter group named Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed responsibility. The same group previously used suicide bombers to attack two Christian churches in Lahore on March 15, killing 15 people and injuring another 70, and a police facility in Lahore on February 17, killing 8 people and injuring another 19.\nTargeted attacks against government officials, humanitarian and non-governmental organization (NGO) employees, tribal elders, and law enforcement personnel continue throughout the country. U.S.citizens have also been targeted. On April 16, 2015, a U.S. educator was seriously injured while driving her own vehicle in Karachi after being shot by two gunmen on motorbikes. Evidence obtained by local police suggests that she was targeted, in part, because she is a U.S. citizen.\nSuicide bomb attacks have occurred in major cities and other locations across the country, including universities, schools, rallies, places of worship, and major marketplaces in several Pakistani cities.\nSectarian violence occurs countrywide. On May 13, 2015, gunmen attacked a bus traveling in Karachi, killing more than 40 of the passengers. Most of the victims were members of the Ismaili Shia Muslim minority community. Members of minority communities have been victims of targeted killings and accusations of blasphemy, a crime that carries the death penalty in Pakistan. Places of worship of various faiths have frequently been targeted for attack by terrorists. U.S. government personnel are prohibited from attending services at places of worship in Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar, and outside of the diplomatic enclave in Islamabad without prior approval. Foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens, on valid missionary visas have encountered increased scrutiny from local authorities since early 2011.\nTRAVEL RESTRICTIONS FOR GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL\nU.S. government personnel travel within Pakistan is often restricted based on security or other reasons. Movements by U.S. government personnel assigned to the Consulates General are severely restricted, and consulate staff cannot drive personally-owned vehicles.\xa0Embassy staff are permitted at times to drive personally-owned vehicles in the greater Islamabad area.\nU.S. personnel in Pakistan who are under Chief of Mission (COM) authority are instructed to vary travel routes and timing, even for routine trips. They are also instructed to minimize the duration of trips to public markets, restaurants, and other locations, as well as to minimize the number of U.S. personnel congregating in any one location at any one time. Personnel and visitors under COM authority are not allowed to use public transportation in Pakistan and are not authorized to stay overnight in hotels in Pakistan. Depending on ongoing security assessments, the U.S. Mission sometimes places public areas such as hotels, markets, restaurants, and Pakistan government offices off-limits to official personnel.\nAccess to many areas of Pakistan, including the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) along the Afghan border, the Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, and the area adjacent to the Line of Control (LOC) in the disputed territory of Kashmir, is restricted by local government authorities for non-Pakistanis. Travel to any restricted region requires official permission from the Government of Pakistan. Failure to obtain such permission in advance can result in arrest and detention by Pakistani authorities. Due to security concerns, the U.S. government currently allows only essential travel within the FATA by U.S. officials. Travel to much of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province and Balochistan is also restricted.\nGENERAL SAFETY AND SECURITY\nThe Mission reiterates its advice to all U.S. citizens to maintain good situational awareness, avoid large crowds, and keep a low profile, particularly when visiting locations frequented by Westerners. U.S. citizens in Pakistan are strongly urged to avoid hotels that do not apply stringent security measures, and to vary times and routes for all travel.\nU.S. citizens in Pakistan have also been kidnapped for ransom or for personal reasons such as family disputes over property. In May 2015, a U.S. citizen was released after being kidnapped in a residential area of Karachi in February. The Mission is aware of other U.S. citizens who have been kidnapped, some released and some still being held. U.S. citizens have also been abducted by terrorists, or abducted by criminal elements and then sold to terrorists, and held hostage for multiple years. The kidnapping of Pakistani citizens and other foreign nationals, usually for ransom, continues to increase nationwide. U.S. citizens who feel they are in danger, or whose security is at risk, are strongly urged to depart Pakistan as soon as possible.\nThe U.S. Consulate in Karachi frequently receives reports from U.S. citizens who have been the victims of robberies at gunpoint.\xa0Many calls involve robberies during transit between Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport and the city. Some of the calls allege involvement by law enforcement.\nU.S. citizens seeking services from the U.S. Consulate General in Karachi might also encounter harassment from host government officials. Citing security concerns, host-government intelligence officials frequently stop U.S. citizens outside the Consulate and obtain their personal information before allowing them to proceed. U.S. citizens might later be visited at their homes or offices and questioned about the nature of their business in Pakistan and the purpose of their visit to the Consulate.\nENTRY/EXIT DIFFICULTIES\nU.S. citizens should ensure that their travel documents and visas are valid before travelling to Pakistan and at all times while in Pakistan. All U.S. citizens regardless of age must have a valid passport and visa for Pakistan, unless they have a Pakistani passport or National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP). U.S. citizens throughout Pakistan have been fined, arrested, deported, harassed, and detained for overstaying their Pakistani visas or for traveling to Pakistan without the appropriate visa classification. U.S. citizens who attempt to renew or extend their visas while in Pakistan have been left without legal status for an extended period of time and subjected to harassment or interrogation by local authorities. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General can provide very limited assistance to U.S. citizens who have overstayed their Pakistani visas. Since 2011, the number of U.S. citizens arrested, detained, and prosecuted for visa overstays has increased across the country.\nU.S. citizens in Pakistan are responsible for monitoring their visa restrictions and abiding by the terms of their visas to ensure they are in compliance with Pakistani immigration regulations. U.S. citizens occasionally notify the Embassy that they are unable to depart the country because their names have been added to the Exit Control List (ECL). The U.S. Embassy is unable to assist in such cases, which must be resolved through Pakistani legal channels.\nSecurity threats might, on short notice, temporarily restrict the ability of the U.S. Missions to provide routine consular services. All U.S. citizens are encouraged to apply for renewal of travel documents at least three months prior to expiration.\nU.S. citizens who travel to or remain in Pakistan despite this Travel Warning are encouraged to enroll with the Embassy in Islamabad or the Consulate General in Karachi. This enrollment can be completed online through the Department of State's\xa0Smart Traveler Enrollment Program\xa0(STEP) available on the Department of State\xa0website. U.S. citizens without internet access should contact the nearest Embassy or Consulate General for information on registering in person. Enrollment enables citizens to obtain updated information on travel and security within Pakistan via the emergency alert system.\nFor further information:""}","[{'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'STEP'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/', 'title': ""State Department's travel website""}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/pakistan.html', 'title': 'Pakistan Country Specific Information'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'Smart Traveler Enrollment Program'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'STEP'}, {'link': 'mailto://travel.state.gov/ACSIslamabad@state.gov', 'title': 'ACSIslamabad@state.gov'}, {'link': 'http://karachi.usconsulate.gov/', 'title': 'U.S. Consulate General in Karachi'}, {'link': 'http://islamabad.usembassy.gov/service/appointments.html', 'title': 'Islamabad'}, {'link': 'http://karachi.usconsulate.gov/service.html', 'title': 'Karachi'}, {'link': 'http://twitter.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Twitter'}, {'link': 'http://www.facebook.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Facebook'}]","2015-12-09 23:25:09","2015-12-09 23:25:09"

The potential for hostile acts exists throughout the country, including kidnappings and the use of chemical warfare against civilian populations. Shelling and aerial bombardment, including of densely populated urban areas, have significantly raised the risk of death or serious injury. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships inside the country.  There is a terrorist threat from violent extremist groups including the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, (ISIL), formerly known as al-Qa’ida in Iraq (AQ), the al-Nusrah Front, and others. Tactics for these groups include the use of suicide bombers, kidnapping, use of small and heavy arms, and improvised explosive devices in major city centers, including Damascus, Aleppo, Hamah, Dara, Homs, Idlib, and Dayr al-Zawr. U.S. citizens have been specifically targeted for kidnapping, both for ransom and political purposes, and murdered by members of terrorist and violent extremist groups in Syria. U.S. citizens have disappeared within Syria. Public places, such as road checkpoints, border crossings, government buildings, shopping areas, and open spaces, have been targeted. Due to the security situation in Syria, the U.S. government’s ability to help U.S. citizens kidnapped or taken hostage is very limited.\nIndividuals who demonstrate an interest in groups opposing ISIL, including on social media, could open themselves to being targeted by ISIL itself if those individuals travel to Syria.\xa0Private U.S. citizens are strongly discouraged from traveling to Syria to take part in the conflict.\xa0The U.S. government does not support this activity, and our ability to provide consular assistance to individuals who are injured or kidnapped, or to the families of individuals who die as a result of taking part in the conflict is extremely limited.\nU.S. citizens are reminded that fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations, including ISIL, can constitute the provision of material support for terrorism, which is a crime that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.\nCommunications in Syria are difficult as phone and internet connections have become increasingly unreliable. The Department of State has received reports that U.S. citizens are experiencing difficulty and facing dangers traveling within the country and when trying to leave Syria via land borders, given the diminishing availability of commercial air travel out of Syria. Fierce clashes between pro-government and opposition forces continue in the vicinity of the Damascus and Aleppo airports. Land border checkpoints held by opposition forces should not be considered safe, as they are targeted by regime attacks and some armed groups have sought to fund themselves through kidnappings for ransom. Border areas are frequent targets of shelling and other attacks and are crowded because of internally-displaced refugees. Errant attacks will occasionally hit border towns just outside the borders as well. Road checkpoints have been controlled by armed terrorist and violent extremist groups and have been utilized to conduct kidnappings of individuals, including U.S. citizens.\nThe U.S. Department of State is concerned about the risks to civil\xa0aviation operating in the Damascus Flight Information Region (FIR) because of the ongoing armed conflict and volatile security environment. This FIR includes all the airspace over Syria and extends into adjacent international airspace. A number of armed extremist groups are known to be equipped with a variety of antiaircraft weapons that have the capability to threaten civil aircraft. The\xa0Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has prohibited U.S. civil aviation\xa0from flying in the Damascus FIR. In addition, U.S. government personnel in Lebanon have been prohibited from taking flights that pass through the Damascus FIR.\xa0For additional background information regarding FAA flight prohibitions and advisories for U.S. civil aviation, U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Damascus suspended its operations in February 2012 and therefore cannot provide protection or routine consular services to U.S. citizens in Syria. The Government of the Czech Republic, acting through its Embassy in Damascus, serves as Protecting Power for U.S. interests in Syria.\xa0The range of consular services the Czech Republic provides to U.S. citizens is extremely limited, and those services, including for U.S. passports and Consular Reports of Birth Abroad, may require significantly more processing time than at U.S. embassies or consulates outside of Syria. U.S. citizens in Syria who seek consular services should leave the country and contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in a neighboring country if at all possible.\xa0U.S. citizens who remain in Syria and require consular services may contact the U.S. Interests Section of the Embassy of the Czech Republic in Damascus at USIS_damascus@embassy.mzv.cz.\nU.S. citizens in Syria who are in need of emergency assistance in Syria, and are unable to reach the U.S. Interests Section of the Embassy of the Czech Republic or must make contact outside business hours, should contact the U.S. Embassy in Amman, Jordan:\nTelephone: +962 (6) 590-6950 (Daily 2-3:30 local time) Emergencies: +962 (6) 590-6500 E-mail: Amman-ACS@state.gov   If you seek information about U.S. citizens\' services in Syria from the Office of Overseas Citizens\' Services in Washington, please e-mail: SyriaEmergencyUSC@state.gov.

(Please see the\xa0Country Specific Information page for Haiti.)\nHaiti's emergency management infrastructure remains in poor condition.\xa0 We strongly encourage visitors to Haiti to obtain evacuation insurance.\xa0 A new private air ambulance company has opened recently, representing a significant advance in response services, but its service is limited.\xa0 Those traveling in rural areas of Haiti should verify service to where they are traveling.\xa0 Additionally, medical facilities in Haiti, including road ambulance services, are particularly weak.\xa0 Some U.S. citizens injured in accidents and others with serious health concerns have been unable to find necessary medical care in Haiti and have had to arrange and pay for medical evacuation to the United States.\nReports of kidnappings have fallen off sharply, with just one incident involving a U.S. citizen reported to the Embassy so far in 2015, continuing a dramatic decline in such crimes since 2011.\xa0 While the Government of Haiti, however, has made progress in arresting and disrupting perpetrators, kidnapping for ransom can still affect anyone in Haiti, most particularly those maintaining long-term residency in the country.\nWe urge U.S. citizens to remain aware of the possibility of robbery, especially in the Port-au-Prince area and in particular soon after leaving the airport.\xa0 While Haitian authorities have taken serious measures to improve airport security and the frequency of these crimes is down, from May to October 2014 there were 64 reported cases of U.S. citizens being robbed shortly after departing the airport, a spike associated with the busy travel period during the summer.\xa0 Three of these robberies resulted in the death of U.S. citizens.\xa0 In almost all cases reported to the Embassy, the victims were U.S. citizens of Haitian descent visiting family and friends.\xa0 Therefore, we urge U.S. citizens to be circumspect in sharing specific travel plans, and we recommend that U.S. citizens have their host or organization meet them at the airport upon arrival and/or have pre-arranged airport transfers and hotels.\xa0 The Embassy is currently monitoring the occurrence of airport robberies as we move into the busy summer travel season.\nWe also urge U.S. citizens to exercise caution when visiting banks in Port-au-Prince.\xa0 Robbery crews have been known to surveil banks and rob customers shortly after departure.\xa0Regions of Haiti outside the capital have reported fewer incidents of crime.\xa0 The Haitian authorities' ability to respond to emergencies is limited, however, and in some areas nonexistent.\xa0 Embassy employees are required to adhere to certain required security and safety measures when traveling outside of Port-au-Prince, and they have restrictions on travel in certain areas or times.\xa0 Additionally, U.S. Embassy personnel are under an Embassy-imposed curfew from 1:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. and must remain at home or another safe facility during curfew hours.\xa0 This may constrain the Embassy’s ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Port-au-Prince.\xa0 For additional details on restrictions on staff travel within Haiti, please see our Country Specific Information for Haiti.\nWhile the United Nations’ Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) currently supports the activities of the Haitian National Police (HNP), their numbers will decrease during 2015 as mandated by the U.N. Security Council.\xa0 The HNP, with assistance from MINUSTAH, is responsible for maintaining order and rendering assistance.\xa0 Given the possibility and unpredictability of spontaneous protests, however, their ability to assist U.S. citizens during disturbances is very limited.\xa0 U.S. government-facilitated evacuations, such as the evacuation that took place from Haiti in 2010, occur only when no safe commercial alternatives exist.\xa0\xa0Please see our website for additional information on how the Department of State assists U.S. citizens during a crisis.\nWe urge U.S. citizens who choose to travel to Haiti to review our\xa0Country Specific Information page.\xa0 U.S. private sector organizations with operations in Haiti can obtain additional information on the security situation in the country through the U.S. Department of State’s Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC).\xa0 OSAC’s mission is to promote security cooperation between U.S. private sector interests worldwide and the U.S. Department of State.\xa0 OSAC also maintains an active Country Council in Haiti to promote the exchange of security-related information.\xa0 The Council is comprised of security professionals and is co-chaired by the Regional Security Officer at the U.S. Embassy Port-au-Prince and a private sector representative.\xa0 U.S. private sector entities can obtain additional information on OSAC by visiting the\xa0OSAC website.\nWe strongly urge U.S. citizens to enroll in the\xa0Smart Traveler Enrollment Program\xa0(STEP) in order to receive the most up-to-date security information.\xa0 While the Embassy's ability to provide emergency consular services is extremely limited, travel enrollment will enable you to receive security messages via email.\xa0 Current information on safety and security can also be obtained by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the United States; callers outside the United States and Canada can receive the information by calling a regular toll line at 1-202-501-4444.

This Travel Warning replaces the Travel Warning for Nigeria dated February 2, 2015.\nThe ability of the Mission to provide assistance to U.S. citizens in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states remains severely limited. The Department continues to recommend against all but essential travel to the following states due to the risk of kidnappings, robberies, and other armed attacks: Adamawa, Bauchi, Bayelsa, Borno, Delta, Gombe, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi, Niger, Plateau, Rivers, Sokoto, Yobe, and Zamfara. The Department also warns against travel in the Gulf of Guinea because of the threat of piracy. Based on safety and security risk assessments, the Embassy maintains restrictions for travel by U.S. officials to those states listed above; officials must receive advance clearance by the U.S. Mission for any travel deemed as mission-essential. U.S. citizens should be aware that extremists could expand their operations beyond northern Nigeria to other areas of the country.\nThe U.S. Mission advises all U.S. citizens to be particularly vigilant around government security facilities; churches, mosques, and other places of worship; locations where large crowds may gather, such as hotels, clubs, bars, restaurants, markets, shopping malls; and other areas frequented by expatriates and foreign travelers. Security measures in Nigeria remain heightened due to threats posed by extremist groups, and U.S. citizens may encounter police and military checkpoints, additional security, and possible road blocks throughout the country.\nBoko Haram, an extremist group based in northeast Nigeria designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the Department of State, has claimed responsibility for many attacks, mainly in northern Nigeria. Its members have killed or wounded thousands of people during the past four years. Boko Haram has targeted churches, schools, mosques, government installations, educational institutions, and entertainment venues in Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Kaduna, Kano, Plateau, Taraba, the Federal Capital Territory, and Yobe states. Hundreds of thousands of Nigerians have been displaced as a result of violence in the north.\n2014-2015 saw an increase in attacks by Boko Haram and clashes with Nigerian government security forces in northern Nigeria. Boko Haram targeted men, women, and children for kidnapping. In April 2014, Boko Haram claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of over 200 school-aged girls in Borno State. Boko Haram is known to descend on whole towns, robbing banks and businesses, attacking police and military installations, and setting fire to private homes. In 2014, extremists also targeted several public markets and transportation hubs in northern Nigeria, including the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja. In Abuja, two explosions occurred in separate attacks at a parking lot in April and May and a shopping center was bombed in June. Several other markets, schools, churches, mosques and bars were targeted throughout the north including an attack with heavy casualties at the central mosque in Kano in November. Boko Haram also claimed responsibility for a suicide attack in Lagos that used a Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Device that killed four at the Apapa port facility on June 25, 2014. In January 2015, Boko Haram attacked the town of Baga in Borno state, resulting in an estimated 2,000 casualties. January - July 2015 saw attacks and suicide bombings in Adamawa, Plateau, Borno, and Kano states.\nVarious curfews are intermittently in effect in several states in the North. All U.S. citizens should remain aware of current situations including curfews, travel restrictions, and states of emergency in the areas they are in or plan to visit. This information is commonly announced via the news media, but at times it can change with very little notice. Please take the time to find out this information for your area.\nCell phone service has, at times, been disrupted in Nigeria, particularly in areas where a State of Emergency has been declared, and when extremists have attacked cellular telephone towers. U.S. citizens should attempt to arrange for multiple means of communication in case of need during emergencies.\nKidnappings remain a security concern throughout the country. Kidnappings are orchestrated by Islamic extremists, predominately in the North, and for ransom by criminal elements in the South. Several high-profile kidnappings occurred in 2014-2015 involving U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals. In September 2014, two U.S citizens were kidnapped in Port Harcourt in two separate incidents. In February 2015, a U.S. citizen was kidnapped in Kogi state. In May 2015, two U.S. citizens were kidnapped in Ondo and Anambra states in separate incidents. Kidnappings of foreign nationals and attacks against Nigerian police forces in Lagos state and the Niger Delta region continued to affect personal security for those traveling in these areas. Criminals or militants have abducted foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens, from off-shore and land-based oil facilities, residential compounds, airports, and public roadways. Local authorities and international corporations operating in Nigeria assert that the number of kidnapping incidents throughout Nigeria remains under-reported. Attacks by pirates off the coast of Nigeria in the Gulf of Guinea have increased substantially in recent years. Armed gangs have boarded both commercial and private vessels to rob travelers. The Nigerian Navy has limited capacity to respond to criminal acts at sea.\nViolent crimes occur throughout the country. U.S. citizen visitors and residents have experienced armed muggings, assaults, burglaries, armed robberies, car-jackings, rapes, kidnappings, and extortion. Home invasions also remain a serious threat, with armed robbers accessing even guarded compounds by scaling perimeter walls, accessing waterfront compounds by boat, following residents or visitors, or subduing guards to gain entry to homes or apartments. Law enforcement authorities usually respond slowly or not at all and provide little or no investigative support to victims. U.S. citizens, other foreign nationals, and Nigerians have experienced harassment and shakedowns at checkpoints and during encounters with Nigerian law enforcement officials.\nFor further information:'}","[{'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/', 'title': ""State Department's travel website""}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'Smart Traveler Enrollment Program'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'STEP'}, {'link': 'mailto://travel.state.gov/AbujaACS@state.gov', 'title': 'AbujaACS@state.gov'}, {'link': 'mailto://travel.state.gov/LagosACS@state.gov', 'title': 'LagosACS@state.gov'}, {'link': 'http://nigeria.usembassy.gov/', 'title': 'U.S. Mission in Nigeria'}, {'link': 'http://twitter.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Twitter'}, {'link': 'http://www.facebook.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Facebook'}]","2015-12-09 23:25:10","2015-12-09 23:25:10"

The Government of Djibouti continues to pursue members of Al-Shabaab involved in a May 2014 terrorist attack.\nOn May 24, 2014, two suicide bombers attacked a restaurant popular with foreigners in Djibouti’s city center.\xa0 One person was killed and several others were severely injured.\xa0 Al-Shabaab claimed initial responsibility and stated that it intended to conduct similar attacks in Djibouti against both native and foreign targets in the future. Such threats have recurred repeatedly since 2011 following Djibouti’s commitment to contribute military forces to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM).\nU.S. citizens in Djibouti should remain vigilant about their personal security, particularly in public places such as shopping areas, hotels, clubs, bars, restaurants, transportation hubs, and places of worship. In addition, they should remain alert while in the presence of large public gatherings.

"http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/niger-travel-warning.html","Niger Travel Warning","2015-07-17 20:56:00","NG","{'value': ""The Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the risks of travel to Niger and specifically recommends citizens avoid travel to the Diffa region, particularly those areas adjacent to Niger’s southern and eastern border, and Lake Chad.\nThe entire Lake Chad region, not only Niger’s border with Nigeria, is especially vulnerable because of rising activities by the extremist group Boko Haram. This replaces the Travel Warning for Niger dated March 27, 2014, to update U.S. citizens on the current security situation in Niger.\nU.S. citizens in Niger, and those considering travel to Niger, should evaluate their personal security situation in light of continuing threats to safety and security. The ability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services in remote and rural areas is limited. U.S. citizens should take steps to mitigate the risk of becoming a victim of violent acts, and reduce exposure to locations routinely frequented by Westerners, including markets, restaurants, bars, and places of worship. Locations such as these have been targeted in the region by violent groups and will likely be targeted in the future.\nTerrorist groups in the past have called for and executed attacks against countries that supported the intervention against terrorist groups in northern Mali, including Niger. Because of terrorist and kidnapping threats, the Embassy Travel Policy requires armed Nigerien security escorts for U.S. government employees’ official travel north of the latitude of Niamey and to the east of Maradi. The areas bordering Mali and Libya, and northern Niger continue to be of serious concern. Additionally, security operations to counter Boko Haram in northern Nigeria and southeastern Niger have resulted in security degradation along the Niger-Nigeria border, primarily east of Maradi. The border is porous, and there are frequent reports of suspected terrorists and smugglers crossing into Niger.\nOn February 6-7, Boko Haram used mortars and suicide bombers to attack Bosso and Diffa town in the Diffa region of Niger. On February 10, the Government of Niger declared a state of emergency in the Diffa region. A curfew has been in place in Diffa region since December 2014.\nIn November 2014, militants mounted a successful multi-pronged attack in the Tillabery region, killing nine Nigerien security members; an unknown number of prisoners escaped from prison in connection with the attack.\nIn June 2013, prisoners in Niamey's main prison staged a prison break. Of the 32 prisoners who successfully escaped, several are suspected to have ties to terrorist organizations. The majority of the escapees remain at large.\nIn May 2013, terrorists using suicide car bombs, explosive vests, and small arms attacked a Nigerien military compound in Agadez and a uranium mining facility operated by a French company in Arlit.\nAl-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), a group designated as a terrorist organization by the Department of State since 2002, continues its threats to kidnap Westerners in Niger, including U.S. citizens, and has kidnapped Europeans in the region. A French family of seven was kidnapped while entering a national park in Cameroon in February 2013 and in November another French citizen was taken from Cameroon. Although there have been no kidnappings of westerners in Niger since January 2011, travelers are urged to exercise extreme caution in Niger due to the seriousness of the kidnapping threats against Westerners. Although the U.S. government places the highest priority on the safe recovery of kidnapped U.S. citizens, it is U.S. government policy not to make concessions to kidnappers.\nOn January 16-17, large-scale protests occurred throughout Niger, resulting in the destruction of more than 45 churches in Niamey alone. The Embassy recommends avoiding large public gatherings, and avoiding travel within the city if you hear reports of demonstrations. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational without warning. As witnessed in the past, Nigerien security services may interrupt cell and social media connection before and during protests.\nThe Government of Niger continues to maintain security checkpoints in Niamey to address security concerns. Be especially careful around security checkpoints, as security forces continue to be on a heightened state of alert. Do not drive away from, or through, a checkpoint until you receive clear permission to do so. If you are uncertain, please request verbal confirmation before proceeding.\nCrime in Niger is a concern. Residential crime targeting homes without guards in Niamey is commonplace. This threat is easily mitigated by having 24/7 residential guards. Most crime in Niamey is non-violent and generally manifests in the form of pick-pocketing or purse-snatching; however, car-jacking and armed robbery can occur. Outside Niamey, the potential for violent crimes increases significantly. Armed bandits target travelers on roads in all parts of the country. Armed escorts are required for all Embassy travel north of Niamey and to, or east of, Maradi. For U.S. government personnel, all travel outside Niamey must occur during daylight hours. We recommend U.S. citizens follow a similar procedure, i.e., travel no earlier than after sunrise and no later than one hour prior to sunset. Throughout Niger, U.S. government travelers stay only at hotels that have armed Nigerien government security.\nAs a result of safety and security concerns, some organizations, including foreign companies, NGOs, and private aid organizations, have temporarily suspended operations in Niger or withdrawn some family members and/or staff.\nFor further information:""}","[{'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/', 'title': ""State Department's public website, travel.state.gov""}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/niger.html', 'title': 'Information'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'Smart Traveler Enrollment Program'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'STEP'}, {'link': 'http://twitter.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Twitter'}, {'link': 'http://www.facebook.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Facebook'}]","2015-12-09 23:25:10","2015-12-09 23:25:10"

Despite the signing of a ceasefire agreement by representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, violent clashes between combined Russian separatist forces and Ukrainian forces continue in parts of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, resulting in thousands of injuries and deaths. The ceasefire agreement established a de facto dividing line between Ukrainian government-controlled and separatist-held areas of Ukraine, with numerous checkpoints controlled by government and separatist forces. Individuals, including U.S. citizens, have been threatened, detained or kidnapped for hours or days after being stopped at separatist checkpoints. The Government of Ukraine has stated that foreigners, including U.S. citizens, who enter Ukraine from Russia through separatist-controlled territory, will not be allowed through checkpoints into government-controlled territory.\nThe Department of State also warns U.S. citizens to defer all travel to the Crimean Peninsula, which is occupied by Russia. The Russian Federation is likely to take further actions in Crimea throughout the remainder of 2015 consistent with its attempted unlawful annexation and occupation of this part of Ukraine. The international community, including the United States and Ukraine, does not recognize this purported annexation. The Russian Federation maintains an extensive military presence in Crimea and along the border of eastern Ukraine. In addition, there are continuing reports of abuses against the local population by de facto authorities in Crimea, particularly against those who are seen as challenging their authority on the peninsula. The Government of Ukraine prevents foreigners, including U.S. citizens, who enter Crimea directly from any country other than Ukraine, from entering mainland Ukraine.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) continues to be concerned about the significant threat to civil aviation operating within Ukraine’s Dnepropetrovsk (UKDV) Flight Information Region (FIR) due to the ongoing attacks by combined Russian-backed separatist forces on Ukrainian forces in parts of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. In addition, the FAA is concerned that civil aircraft operating in the Simferopol (UKFV) FIR may receive conflicting air traffic control instructions from both Ukrainian and Russian air traffic service providers as the result of the Russian Federation’s purported annexation of this area. As a result, as of 2014 the FAA prohibits U.S. civil aviation from flying in the Ukrainian Simferopol and Dnepropetrovsk FIRS. This prohibition remains in effect. For additional background information regarding FAA flight prohibitions and advisories for U.S. civil aviation, consult the FAA’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices web page.\nThe situation in Ukraine is unpredictable and could change quickly. U.S. citizens throughout Ukraine should avoid large crowds and be prepared to remain indoors should protests or demonstrations escalate. U.S. citizens should especially exercise extreme vigilance in public places in the regions of Odesa and Kharkiv due to a continuing increase in small scale terrorism incidents.\nU.S. Embassy Kyiv's Consular Section is open for all public services; however, in light of the ongoing unrest, the Embassy has severely restricted the travel of U.S. government personnel to Donetsk, Luhansk and the Crimean Peninsula, and occasionally limits travel to other adjacent regions. As a result, the Embassy's ability to provide consular services, including responding to emergencies, to U.S. citizens in eastern Ukraine and Ukraine's Crimean region is extremely limited.\nFor further information:""}","[{'link': 'https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions', 'title': 'FAA’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices web page.'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/', 'title': ""State Department's travel website""}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'http://www.travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/ukraine.html', 'title': 'Ukraine Country Specific Information'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'Smart Traveler Enrollment Program'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'STEP'}, {'link': 'http://ukraine.usembassy.gov/', 'title': 'U.S. Embassy in Ukraine'}, {'link': 'mailto://travel.state.gov/UkraineEmergencyUSC@state.gov', 'title': 'UkraineEmergencyUSC@state.gov'}, {'link': 'http://twitter.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Twitter'}, {'link': 'http://www.facebook.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Facebook'}]","2015-12-09 23:25:10","2015-12-09 23:25:10"

The U.S. Embassy has little capacity to reach U.S. citizens with emergencies outside Juba due to the poor security situation and lack of critical infrastructure. Additionally, the U.S. Embassy is rarely informed of the arrest of U.S. citizens in a timely manner and consular assistance to detainees both in Juba and outside the capital is extremely limited. U.S. citizens traveling to South Sudan despite this warning should develop contingency plans prior to arrival to ensure their safety and security.\xa0This Travel Warning supersedes the Travel Warning issued January 7, 2015.\nThe South Sudanese government is currently engaged in an armed conflict with opposition forces led by the former vice president Riek Machar, which has led to the displacement of more than two million people. Although the conflict is primarily concentrated in Unity, Jonglei, and Upper Nile states, other areas of the country have experienced periodic fighting.\xa0Instability persists across the country due to retaliatory attacks, intercommunal violence and cattle raiding, and economic uncertainty.\nHealth care in South Sudan is extremely limited and poor. U.S. citizens with medical conditions should not travel to South Sudan, and all travelers should ensure their travel is covered by overseas medical insurance, including medical evacuation.\nThe government of South Sudan has limited capacity to deter crime or provide security to travelers, particularly outside of Juba.\xa0In addition to instability related to the current armed conflict, the risk of violent crime is high in South Sudan. The U.S. Embassy in Juba has imposed a curfew from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. and has implemented other measures to protect U.S. government personnel living and working in South Sudan. These include requiring personnel to travel in armored government vehicles and coordinating with the host government for travel outside of Juba. Due to security concerns, spouses and family members of U.S. government personnel are not permitted to reside in South Sudan. U.S. citizens should consider those restrictions and take measures to mitigate exposure to violent crime and other threats. U.S. citizens currently working on humanitarian relief or development efforts in Juba, or elsewhere in South Sudan, should closely follow the security policies and procedures of the sponsoring organization.\nCarjackings and banditry are common in South Sudan. If travel outside of Juba is necessary, it should be undertaken preferably with a minimum of two vehicles with appropriate recovery and medical equipment in case of mechanical failure or other emergency. Additionally, there are widespread fuel shortages across South Sudan, and access to gasoline and or diesel cannot be guaranteed.\nFor further information:'}","[{'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/', 'title': ""State Department's travel website""}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/south-sudan.html', 'title': 'Country Specific Information for South Sudan'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'Smart Traveler Enrollment Program'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'STEP'}, {'link': 'http://twitter.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Twitter'}, {'link': 'http://www.facebook.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Facebook'}]","2015-12-09 23:25:10","2015-12-09 23:25:10"
"http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/el-salvador-travel-warning.html","El Salvador Travel Warning","2015-06-23 03:42:00","ES","{'value': ""The Department of State continues to warn U.S. citizens that crime and violence levels in El Salvador remain high, and U.S. citizens traveling to El Salvador should remain alert to their surroundings.\nThis Travel Warning supersedes the Travel Warning dated November 21, 2014, and includes updated information on crime and security in El Salvador.\nTens of thousands of U.S. citizens safely visit El Salvador each year for study, tourism, cruise ship visits, business, and volunteer work. There is no information to suggest that U.S. citizens are specifically targeted by criminals; however, crime and violence are serious problems throughout the country. Since January 2010, 34 U.S. citizens have been murdered in El Salvador including a nine-year-old child in December 2013. During the same time period, 419 U.S. citizens reported having their passports stolen, while others were victims of violent crimes.\nTypical crimes in El Salvador include extortion, mugging, highway assault, home invasion, and car theft. There have also been cases reported in which criminals observe and follow customers making withdrawals at ATMs and banks, then rob them on the road or at a residence. Some victims unwittingly wander into gang-controlled territory and may be targeted, normally at night. Assaults against police officers have risen, and public shootouts are not uncommon. Armed robberies of climbers and hikers in El Salvador’s national parks are known to occur, and the Embassy strongly recommends engaging the services of a local guide certified by the national or local tourist authority when hiking in back country areas -- even within the national parks. The National Civilian Police (PNC) has a special tourist police force (POLITUR) to provide security and assistance to visitors. It has officers located in 19 tourist destinations.\nA majority of serious crimes are never solved; only six of the 34 murders of U.S. citizens since January 2010 have resulted in convictions. The Government of El Salvador lacks sufficient resources to properly investigate and prosecute cases and to deter violent crime. While several of the PNC’s investigative units have shown great promise, routine street-level patrol techniques, anti-gang, and crime suppression efforts are limited. Equipment shortages (particularly radios, vehicles, and fuel) further limit their ability to deter or respond to crimes effectively.\nEl Salvador, a country of roughly six million people, has, according to Government of El Salvador statistics, thousands of known gang members from several gangs including Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Eighteenth Street (M18). Gang members are quick to engage in violence or use deadly force if resisted. These “maras” concentrate on narcotics and arms trafficking, murder for hire, carjacking, extortion, and violent street crime. Authorities believe a significant number of disappearances are related to gang activity, since many of the missing were in gangs or were friends or family members of gang members. Police sources claim that the families of gang members often face the same risks of being killed or disappearing as the gang members themselves.\nExtortion is a very common crime in El Salvador. Some extortion attempts are no more than random cold calls that originate from imprisoned gang members using cellular telephones, and the subsequent threats against the victim are made through social engineering and/or through information obtained about the victim’s family. U.S. citizens who are visiting El Salvador for extended periods are at higher risk for extortion demands. Many extortions and other crimes are not reported by victims for fear of reprisal and lack of faith in the ability of the government to protect the victims.\nU.S. citizens should remain alert to their surroundings, especially when entering or exiting their homes or hotels, cars, garages, schools, and workplaces. Whenever possible, travel in groups. U.S. Embassy security officials advise all U.S. government personnel not to walk, run, or cycle in unguarded streets and parks, even in groups, and recommend exercising only in gyms and fitness centers. Avoid wearing expensive jewelry, and do not carry large sums of money or display cash, ATM/credit cards, or other valuables. Avoid walking at night in most areas of El Salvador. Incidents of crime along roads, including carjacking, are common in El Salvador. Motorists should avoid traveling at night and always drive with their doors locked to deter potential robberies at traffic lights and on congested downtown streets. Travel on public transportation, especially buses, both within and outside the capital, is risky and not recommended. The Embassy advises official visitors and personnel to avoid using mini-buses and regular buses and to use only radio-dispatched taxis or those stationed in front of major hotels.\nFor more detailed information regarding personal security, please see the State Department's Country Specific Information for El Salvador.

We urge U.S. citizens to avoid all travel to the Darfur region of Sudan, and to Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan states, and advise U.S. citizens to consider carefully the risks of travel in other areas of Sudan.\nThis supersedes the Travel Warning issued on October 30, 2014.\nWhile the Government of Sudan has taken steps to limit the activities of terrorist groups, elements of these groups remain in Sudan and have in the past threatened to attack Western interests. Terrorist actions may include suicide operations, bombings, or kidnappings. U.S. citizens should be aware of the risk of indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets in public places, including tourist sites and locations where westerners are known to congregate, as well as commercial operations associated with U.S. or Western interests. The terrorist threat level throughout Sudan, and particularly in the Darfur region, remains critical, and the U.S. Embassy has implemented enhanced security measures to protect U.S. government personnel assigned to Sudan. These measures include requiring U.S. government personnel to travel in armored vehicles at all times, and to obtain advance permission for travel outside of Khartoum. In addition, family members of U.S. personnel under age 21 are not allowed to reside in Sudan.\nU.S. citizens traveling or residing anywhere in Sudan should exercise caution at all times and closely monitor local and international news from reliable sources. Violent flare-ups break out with little notice between and among various armed groups, Sudanese security forces and militias, particularly in the Darfur region, along the border between Chad and Sudan, and in areas that border South Sudan. Inter- and intra- tribal violence and armed acts of banditry are prevalent in these areas. Near the border with Ethiopia and Eritrea, landmines and unmarked minefields are a critical threat. There are occasional clashes with local tribes, particularly those known for weapons and human trafficking, along with the threats of Ethiopian gangs crossing the border to rob people along the highway. Hostilities between Sudanese forces and armed opposition groups present real and immediate dangers to travelers in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan states, including the disputed area of Abyei. Government security forces may detain U.S. citizens who are in these areas without Sudanese government permission.\nDemonstrations occur periodically, mostly in Khartoum and Omdurman. In September 2012, the U.S. Embassy was attacked during a violent protest demonstration and, in September 2013, Khartoum and other urban areas witnessed violent confrontations between authorities and demonstrators protesting economic austerity measures. Smaller demonstrations occur periodically in Khartoum city. Avoid all public demonstrations and political rallies, as even peaceful demonstrations can become violent with little or no warning. Keep a low profile, vary times and routes of travel, exercise care while driving, and ensure that passports and Sudanese visas are always valid and up to date.\nThe threat of violent crime, including kidnappings, armed robberies, home invasions, and carjackings, is particularly high in the Darfur region of Sudan, as the Government of Sudan has taken limited action to deter crime in that region. In addition, tribal militias and armed Darfuri rebel groups are known to have carried out criminal attacks against foreigners. A number of foreign nationals have been kidnapped for ransom by criminal groups in Darfur. Due to the fluid security situation, U.S. government personnel are not authorized to travel to Darfur except to certain areas and with appropriate security precautions.\nThe United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) has advised that regional tensions entail the risk of maritime attacks being conducted against vessels operating in the Gulf of Oman, North Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, and the Bab el Mandeb regions.\nMARAD recommends vessels at anchor, operating in restricted maneuvering environments, or at slow speeds should be especially vigilant, and report suspicious activity. U.S. flag vessels that observe suspicious activity in the area are advised to report such suspicious activity or any hostile or potentially hostile action to COMUSNAVCENT battlewatch captain at phone number 973-1785-3879. Report all suspicious activities and events to the U.S. Coast Guard National Response Center at the following toll free telephone: 1-800-424-8802, direct telephone 202-267-2675, or TDD 202-267-4477. The complete advisory is available on the MARAD website at\xa0www.MARAD.DOT.gov.\nWe recommend that all U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Sudan maintain safe haven plans, as well as plans to evacuate the country on short notice should the situation warrant. If the security situation worsens or if specific threats affecting the safety of U.S. citizens are discovered, we will make this information available through the U.S. Embassy website and by messages communicated through our warden system.\xa0Emergency and Security Messages for U.S. Citizens\xa0in Sudan can be found on our\xa0website.\nThe ability of the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum to provide services to U.S. citizens in emergency situations outside of the Khartoum area is very limited, and dependent on security conditions. The ability to provide assistance is particularly limited in southern regions of Sudan and in Darfur.\nStay informed and get updates by checking the\xa0U.S. Embassy website.

Security in Colombia has improved significantly in recent years, including in tourist and business travel destinations such as Bogota, Cartagena, Barranquilla, Medellin, and Cali.\xa0 However, violence linked to narco-trafficking continues to affect some rural and urban areas.\xa0This Travel Warning replaces the previous travel warning released on April 14, 2014, with minor changes to the travel restrictions for U.S. government officials and their families in Colombia.\xa0 It was reviewed on June 5, 2015 with no changes.\nThere have been no reports of U.S. citizens targeted specifically for their nationality. While the U.S. Embassy has no information regarding specific and credible threats against U.S. citizens in Colombia, both the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia – People’s Army (FARC) and National Liberation Army (ELN) terrorist groups continue to condemn any U.S. influence in Colombia.\xa0 The Department of State strongly encourages U.S. citizens to exercise caution and remain vigilant as terrorist and criminal activities remain a threat throughout the country. Explosions occur throughout Colombia on a regular basis, including in Bogota. Small towns and rural areas of Colombia can be extremely dangerous due to the presence of terrorists and\xa0 criminal elements, including armed gangs (referred to as ""BACRIM"" in Spanish), that are active throughout much of the country. Violence associated with the BACRIM has spilled over into many of Colombia\'s major cities. These groups are heavily involved in the drug trade, extortion, kidnapping, and robbery.\nThe incidence of kidnapping in Colombia has diminished significantly from its peak in 2000.\xa0 However, kidnapping remains a threat. Terrorist groups and other criminal organizations continue to kidnap and hold civilians, including foreigners, for ransom.\xa0 No one is immune from kidnapping on the basis of occupation, nationality, or other factors.\xa0 The U.S. government places the highest priority on the safe recovery of kidnapped U.S. citizens, but it is U.S. policy not to make concessions to kidnappers.\nU.S. government officials in Colombia regularly travel to the major cities of Colombia such as Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Barranquilla, and Cartagena without incident. U.S. government officials and their families in Colombia normally are permitted to travel to major cities only by air. They may not use inter- or intra-city bus transportation, or travel by road outside urban areas at night. U.S. government officials in Colombia and their families are restricted to traveling within certain areas. This includes using the main highways to travel between Bogota and Bucaramanga, and between Bogota and Ibague. Personnel are also allowed to drive between Manizales, Pereira, and Armenia and within the “coffee country” departments of Caldas, Risaralda, and Quindío. On the Caribbean coast, personnel are restricted to driving along Highway 90 from Cartagena, through Barranquilla to Santa Marta.\xa0 Travel to all other areas of Colombia is off limits unless specific authorization is granted.\xa0 All U.S. citizens in Colombia are urged to follow these precautions and exercise extra caution outside of the aforementioned areas.\nFor more detailed information on staying safe in Colombia, please see the State Department\'s\xa0Country Specific Information\xa0for Colombia. For the latest security information, U.S. citizens traveling abroad should regularly monitor the Bureau of Consular Affairs\'\xa0internet web site, where the current Worldwide Caution, Travel Warnings, and Travel Alerts can be found. Follow us on\xa0Twitter\xa0and the\xa0Bureau of Consular Affairs page\xa0on Facebook as well.\nUp-to-date information on security can also be obtained by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll free in the United States and Canada or, for callers outside the United States and Canada, a regular toll line at 001-202-501-4444. These numbers are available from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays). U.S. citizens living or traveling in Colombia are encouraged to enroll with the\xa0State Department\'s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program\xa0to obtain updated information on travel and security within Colombia. For any emergencies involving U.S. citizens in Colombia, please contact the U.S. Embassy or the closest U.S. Consulate as listed below.\nThe U.S. Embassy is located at Calle 24 Bis No. 48-50 Bogota, D.C., Colombia. Mailing address: Carrera 45 No. 24B-27 Bogota, D.C., Colombia. In case of a serious emergency that jeopardizes the health or safety of a U.S. citizen in Colombia, please call the Embassy at (+57-1) 275-2000; Embassy fax: (+57-1) 275-4501; Consular Section phone: (+57-1) 275-4900. The Embassy\'s American Citizens Services office provides routine information at http://bogota.usembassy.gov. For questions not answered there, inquiries may be sent by email to\xa0ACSBogota@state.gov.\nThe U.S. Consular Agency in Barranquilla, which accepts passport applications and performs notarial services, is located at Calle 77B, No. 57-141, Piso 5, Centro Empresarial Las Americas, Barranquilla, Atlantico, Colombia; telephone (+57-5) 353-2001/353-2182/369-0149.

"http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/lebanon-travel-warning.html","Lebanon Travel Warning","2015-05-30 03:13:00","LE","{'value': ""The Department of State urges U.S. citizens to avoid all travel to Lebanon because of ongoing safety and security concerns.\nU.S. citizens living and working in Lebanon should understand that they accept the risks of remaining in the country and should carefully consider those risks.\xa0 In the past two years, two U.S. citizens have died in bombings, and two have been kidnapped, according to information available to the U.S. government.\xa0 This supersedes the Travel Warning issued on November 26, 2014.\nIn August 2014, extremists from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and al-Nusrah Front (ANF) attacked the Lebanese military in the Bekaa valley town of Arsal, along the border with Syria.\xa0 There have been episodic clashes between the Lebanese army and Syrian-based extremists along the border with Syria since August 2014.\xa0 U.S. citizens in Lebanon should monitor ongoing political and security developments in both Lebanon and Syria.\xa0 There have also been incidents of cross-border shelling and air strikes of Lebanese villages from Syria, which resulted in deaths and injuries.\xa0 There have been reports of armed groups from Syria who kidnapped or attacked Lebanese citizens living in the border area. Clashes between Lebanese authorities and criminal elements occurred in areas of the Bekaa Valley and border regions.\xa0 Similar incidents could occur again without warning.\xa0 With the potential for violence and abductions, the U.S. Embassy strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid the Lebanese-Syrian border region.\nThere are border tensions to the south with Israel as well.\xa0 In January 2015, hostilities between Israel and Hizballah flared in the Golan Heights and Shebaa Farms area, and the potential for wider conflict remains.\xa0 South of the Litani River, Hizballah has stockpiled large amounts of munitions in anticipation of a future conflict with Israel.\xa0 In addition, during the summer of 2014 there were sporadic rocket attacks from southern Lebanon into Israel in connection with the violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\xa0 These attacks, normally consisting of a few unsophisticated rockets fired at northern Israel, often provoke a prompt Israeli military response in the form of artillery fire.\xa0 The rocket attacks and responses can occur without warning.\xa0 Landmines and unexploded ordnance pose significant dangers throughout southern Lebanon, particularly south of the Litani River, as well as in areas of the country where fighting was intense during the civil war.\xa0 More than 40 civilians have been killed and more than 300 injured by unexploded ordnance since the 2006 Israel-Hizballah war.\xa0 Travelers should watch for posted landmine warnings and strictly avoid all areas where landmines and unexploded ordnance may be present.\nSudden outbreaks of violence can occur at any time in Lebanon, and armed clashes have occurred in major cities.\xa0 After the implementation of the security plan in Tripoli, the neighborhoods of Bab al-Tabbaneh\xa0and Jabal Mohsen remain tense.\xa0 Two suicide bombers struck a café in Jabal Mohsen in January 2015, causing dozens of casualties.\xa0 Armed clashes have resulted in numerous deaths and injuries in the past, and there are potentially large numbers of weapons in the hands of non-governmental elements.\xa0 The Lebanese Armed Forces are routinely brought in to quell the violence in these situations.\xa0 The Lebanese government cannot guarantee protection for U.S. citizens or visitors to the country in the event violence occurs suddenly.\xa0 Public demonstrations occur with little warning and have become violent in some instances.\xa0 Family, neighborhood, or sectarian disputes can escalate quickly and can lead to gunfire or other violence with no warning.\xa0 U.S. citizens have died in such incidents.\xa0 The ability of U.S. government personnel to reach travelers or provide emergency services is severely limited.\xa0 Protesters have blocked major roads to gain publicity for their causes, including the primary road between downtown Beirut and Rafiq Hariri International Airport temporarily without warning.\xa0 Access to the airport may be cut off if the security situation deteriorates.\nExtremist groups operate in Lebanon, including Hizballah, ISIL, ANF, and the Abdullah Azzam Brigades (AAB).\xa0 The U.S. government has designated all of these groups as terrorist organizations. ISIL and ANF have claimed responsibility for suicide bombings in Lebanon, and these groups are active in northern Lebanon, the Bekaa Valley, and in border areas with Syria. U.S. citizens have been the target of terrorist attacks in Lebanon in the past, and the threat of anti-Western terrorist activity remains.\xa0 U.S. citizens traveling or residing in Lebanon despite this Travel Warning should keep a low profile, assess their personal security, and vary times and routes for all required travel.\xa0 U.S. citizens also should pay close attention to their personal security at locations where Westerners generally are known to congregate, and should avoid demonstrations and large gatherings.\xa0 They should consider avoiding areas where bombings have taken place recently.\xa0 The most recent Security Messages are posted on the\xa0U.S. Embassy Beirut website.\nThere is potential for death or injury in Lebanon because of terrorist bombings.\xa0 Many of the attacks have targeted specific individuals or venues, but nearly all cases have resulted in death and injuries to innocent bystanders.\xa0 Although there is no evidence that these attacks were directed specifically at U.S. citizens, there is a real possibility of “wrong place, wrong time” harm.\xa0 The last wave of bombings in Beirut began in June 2013 and ended in mid-2014 with hundreds of dead and injured, including at least two U.S. citizens killed.\xa0 The security services have made great progress in improving their capacity to detect and intercept terrorist attacks, resulting in a marked decline in suicide and car bombs, but many extremist groups remain actively engaged in planning attacks.\xa0 These regularly involve suicide bombers, many of whom have detonated their vests or vehicles short of their targets.\nHizballah maintains a strong presence in parts of south Beirut, the Bekaa Valley, and areas in southern Lebanon. \xa0Hizballah has been the target of attacks by other extremist groups for their support of the Asad regime in Syria.\xa0 The potential for violence between Hizballah and other extremist groups throughout the country remains a strong possibility.\xa0 Hizballah and other groups have at times detained and extensively interrogated U.S. citizens or other foreigners for political motivations.\nPalestinian groups hostile to both the Lebanese government and the United States operate autonomously in refugee camps in different areas of the country.\xa0 Intra-communal violence within the camps has resulted in shootings and explosions.\xa0 U.S. citizens should avoid Palestinian refugee camps.\nKidnapping, whether for ransom or political motives, remains a problem in Lebanon, and U.S. citizens have been victims of such acts in recent years.\xa0 Kidnappers have abducted business people under the guise of coming to Lebanon for meetings.\xa0 Suspects in kidnappings sometimes have ties to terrorist or criminal organizations.\xa0 The U.S. government’s ability to help U.S. citizens kidnapped or taken hostage is very limited.\xa0 Although the U.S. government places the highest priority on the safe recovery of kidnapped U.S. citizens, it is U.S. policy to not make concessions to hostage takers.\xa0 U.S. law also makes it illegal to provide material support to terrorist organizations.\nThe U.S. Department of State wishes to warn U.S. citizens of the risk of traveling on airlines that fly over Syria.\xa0 As we have seen in the recent past, commercial aircraft are at risk when flying over regions in conflict.\xa0 We strongly recommend that U.S. citizens considering air travel overseas evaluate the route that their proposed commercial flight may take and avoid any that pass through Syrian airspace.\xa0 U.S. government personnel in Lebanon have been prohibited from taking flights that pass through Syrian airspace.\xa0 Flight paths are subject to change, so travelers should check with their airline to verify their flight’s route before traveling.\nThe Department of State considers the threat to U.S. government personnel in Beirut sufficiently serious to require them to live and work under strict security restrictions.\xa0 The internal security policies of the U.S. Embassy may be adjusted at any time and without advance notice.\xa0 These practices limit, and may prevent, access by U.S. Embassy officials to certain areas of the country, especially to parts of metropolitan Beirut, Tripoli, the Bekaa Valley, and southern Lebanon.\xa0 Because of security concerns, unofficial travel to Lebanon by U.S. government employees and their family members is strictly limited, and requires the Department of State’s prior approval.\nIn the event that the security climate in Lebanon worsens, U.S. citizens will be responsible for arranging their own travel out of Lebanon.\xa0 U.S. citizens should be aware that the Embassy does not offer protection services to individuals who feel unsafe.\xa0 U.S. citizens with special medical or other needs should be aware of the risks of remaining given their condition, and should be prepared to seek treatment in Lebanon if they cannot arrange for travel out of the country.\nU.S. government-facilitated evacuations, such as the evacuation that took place from Lebanon in 2006, occur only when no safe commercial alternatives exist.\xa0 Evacuation assistance is provided on a cost-recovery basis, which means the traveler must reimburse the U.S. government for travel costs.\xa0 The lack of a valid U.S. passport may hinder U.S. citizens' ability to depart the country and may slow the U.S. Embassy's ability to provide assistance.\xa0 U.S. citizens in Lebanon should therefore ensure that they have proper and current documentation at all times.\xa0 U.S. Legal Permanent Residents should consult with the Department of Homeland Security before they depart the United States to ensure they have proper documentation to re-enter.\xa0 Further information on the Department’s role during emergencies is provided on the Bureau of Consular Affairs’\xa0website.\nU.S. citizens living or traveling in Lebanon should enroll in the Department of State’s Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP), on the Bureau of Consular Affairs’ website, Travel.State.Gov, to receive the latest travel updates and information and to obtain updated information on travel and security within Lebanon.\xa0 U.S. citizens without Internet access may enroll directly with the U.S. Embassy in Beirut.\xa0 By enrolling, U.S. citizens make it easier for the Embassy to contact them in case of emergency.\xa0 The U.S. Embassy is located in Awkar, near Antelias, Beirut, Lebanon.\xa0 Public access hours for U.S. citizens are Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.\xa0 U.S. citizens must make\xa0appointments\xa0in advance.\xa0 U.S. citizens who require emergency services outside these hours may contact the Embassy by telephone at any time.\xa0 The Embassy’s telephone numbers are (961-4) 542-600, (961-4) 543-600, and fax (961-4) 544-209 (Note: the (961) is only necessary when dialing from outside the country.\xa0 When dialing inside the country, use ‘0’ before the number, e.g., 04 542-600).\nInformation on consular services and enrollment in STEP can also be found at the\xa0U.S. Embassy in Beirut's website, or by phone at the above telephone numbers between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday local time.\xa0 U.S. citizens in Lebanon may also contact the consular section by email at\xa0BeirutACS@state.gov.\nUp-to-date information on travel and security can also be obtained by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the United States and Canada or, for callers outside the United States and Canada, on a regular toll line at 1-202-501-4444.\xa0 These numbers are available from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays).\nFor additional information, U.S. citizens should consult the Department of State’s Country Specific Information for Lebanon.\xa0 Travelers can also stay up to date by bookmarking our\xa0Bureau of Consular Affairs website,\xa0Travel.State.Gov, which

"http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/eritrea-travel-warning.html","Eritrea Travel Warning","2015-05-06 04:12:00","ER","{'value': ""The U.S. Department of State continues to warn U.S. citizens of the risks of travel to Eritrea.\nThe Government of Eritrea continues to restrict the travel of all foreign nationals, including U.S. diplomats posted in Asmara.\xa0 Consequently, the U.S. Embassy cannot guarantee its ability to provide emergency consular assistance outside of Asmara.\xa0 In addition, contrary to its obligations under the Vienna Convention, the Government of Eritrea does not notify the U.S. Embassy when a U.S. citizen is detained or arrested.\xa0 U.S. citizens of Eritrean ethnicity are often subject to the same laws and obligations as Eritrean nationals, particularly those who enter the country using their Eritrean identity card in lieu of a U.S. passport with an Eritrean visa.\xa0 This Travel Warning replaces the Travel Warning for Eritrea dated September 12, 2014.\nThe Eritrean government continues to restrict the travel of all foreign nationals.\xa0 These restrictions require all visitors and residents, including U.S. diplomats, to apply 10 days in advance for permission to travel beyond 25 kilometers (15 miles) of Asmara’s city limits.\xa0 While permission is often granted for popular tourist destinations such as Massawa and Keren, requests to travel near the border areas, particularly with Ethiopia and Djibouti, are regularly denied.\xa0 Requests by U.S. diplomats to travel to areas outside of Asmara are also routinely turned down, thus impairing the ability of consular officers to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in areas outside Asmara.\nTravelers should be aware that travel permits are valid for the approved final destination only, and do not allow for stops along the way to or in the proximity of the approved destination.\xa0 In addition, travel to religious institutions, such as monasteries, requires separate travel permissions even when such facilities are located in or near approved destination cities.\xa0 Foreign travelers not adhering strictly to the terms of travel permits have reported being detained by law enforcement authorities.\nU.S. citizens are strongly advised to avoid travel near the Eritrean-Ethiopian border and the Southern Red Sea Region because of the presence of large numbers of Eritrean and Ethiopian troops along the contested border area, and because of the military tensions between the two countries.\xa0 U.S. citizens should also avoid travel to the contested Eritrea-Djibouti border region, where troops from Qatar patrol this area and tensions remain high.\nLandmines and unexploded ordnance remain a serious problem in parts of the country.\xa0 Some areas still have not been certified free of mines and unexploded ordnance following the 30-year war of independence and the subsequent 1998-2000 border conflict with Ethiopia.\xa0 Visitors should avoid walking alone and hiking in riverbeds or areas that local government officials have not certified as safe.\nEritrea has complicated citizenship laws and does not recognize renunciation of Eritrean citizenship.\xa0 U.S. citizens born in Eritrea to Eritrean parents or who in other ways may have Eritrean origins are required by the Government of Eritrea to register with the Immigration and Nationality Office in Asmara within seven business days of their entry into the country.\xa0 The Eritrean government sometimes subjects U.S. citizens of Eritrean ethnicity to the same entry/exit requirements as Eritrean citizens, including obtaining an exit permit.\xa0 Dual nationals, who enter the country on Eritrean travel documents, including a national ID, are treated as Eritrean citizens, regardless of their dual citizenship status and may be subject to additional obligations.\xa0 Dual nationals may not be able to obtain Eritrean civil documents, such as birth and death certificates, marriage and divorce documents, educational transcripts, or property ownership records, without proof of payment of the two percent government diaspora tax.\nU.S. citizens choosing to travel to Eritrea despite this Travel Warning must obtain an Eritrean visa before their arrival.\xa0 Persons arriving in Eritrea without a visa are generally refused admission and returned to their point of origin on the next flight unless prior arrangements were made for an airport visa.\nIn connection with the May 24 Independence Day holiday, travelers will notice an increase in the presence of military and police personnel throughout Asmara during the months of April and May.\xa0 It is during these two months that military and police personnel most frequently check documentation.\nAlthough there have been no specific incidents of violence targeting U.S. citizens, U.S. citizens are urged to exercise caution, stay current with media coverage of local events, and be aware of their surroundings at all times.\nPiracy on the Red Sea continues to occur and recreational vessels are strongly encouraged to avoid the region.\xa0 Commercial vessels without explicit agreements with Eritrean authorities are urged to avoid Eritrean territorial waters.\xa0 The Eritrean government has, as recently as December 2013, seized ships which do not hold such agreement.\xa0 These seizures have resulted in lengthy detentions of international crew members, including U.S. nationals.\xa0 U.S. citizens are cautioned that commercial/tourist ships are not allowed to dock at some Eritrean ports, even to refuel.\xa0 The Eritrean government has not granted the U.S. Coast Guard access to Eritrean ports to assess safety and security conditions despite repeated requests to do so.\xa0 U.S. citizens should consult the Maritime Administration's\xa0Horn of Africa Piracy page\xa0for information on maritime advisories, self-protection measures, and naval forces in the region.\nModern telecommunications options are limited in Eritrea and cannot be counted upon in an emergency.\xa0 International cell phone service plans do not work on Eritrean networks.\xa0 Local cellular phone service is tightly controlled by the Eritrean government and difficult to obtain.\xa0 When available, international cell phone calls are extremely expensive and only available using pre-paid minutes.\xa0 Internet cafés are widespread but sometimes lack power, and internet service is often very slow, unreliable, and does not support Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services such as Skype.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Asmara urges citizens who travel or remain in Eritrea despite this travel warning to enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP), so you can receive the most up-to-date security information.\xa0 Please keep all of your information in STEP current.\nU.S. citizens should consult the Country Specific Information for Eritrea\xa0and the Worldwide Caution, both located on the Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs website.\xa0 Current information on safety and security can also be obtained by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the United States and Canada, or a regular toll line at 1-202-501-4444 from other countries.\xa0 These numbers are available from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays).\nStay up to date by bookmarking our Bureau of Consular Affairs website, which contains the current Travel Warnings\xa0and Travel Alerts\xa0as well as the Worldwide Caution.\xa0 Follow us on Twitter\xa0and the Bureau of Consular Affairs page on Facebook\xa0as well.\nThe consular section of the U.S. Embassy in Asmara is open for all U.S. citizen services on Thursday afternoon by appointment only.\xa0 In the case of an emergency, please contact the Embassy for an emergency appointment.\xa0 The U.S. Embassy in Asmara is located at 179 Alaa Street, P.O.

"http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/mexico-travel-warning.html","Mexico Travel Warning","2015-05-05 14:37:00","MX","{'value': 'The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens about the risk of traveling to certain places in Mexico due to threats to safety and security posed by organized criminal groups in the country.\nU.S. citizens have been the victims of violent crimes, such as kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery by organized criminal groups in various Mexican states. For information on security conditions in specific regions of Mexico, which can vary, travelers should reference the state-by-state assessments further below. This Travel Warning replaces the Travel Warning for Mexico, issued April 13, 2015, to update information about the security situation and to advise the public of additional restrictions on the travel of U.S. government (USG) personnel.\nGeneral Conditions:\nMillions of U.S. citizens safely visit Mexico each year for study, tourism, and business, including more than 150,000 who cross the border every day. The Mexican government dedicates substantial resources to protect visitors to major tourist destinations, and there is no evidence that organized criminal groups have targeted U.S. visitors or residents based on their nationality. Resort areas and tourist destinations in Mexico generally do not see the levels of drug-related violence and crime that are reported in the border region or in areas along major trafficking routes.\nNevertheless, U.S. travelers should be aware that the Mexican government has been engaged in an extensive effort to counter organized criminal groups that engage in narcotics trafficking and other unlawful activities throughout Mexico. Crime and violence are serious problems and can occur anywhere, and U.S. citizens have fallen victim to criminal activity, including homicide, gun battles, kidnapping, carjacking, and highway robbery. While many of those killed in organized crime-related violence have themselves been involved in criminal activity, innocent persons have also been killed. The number of U.S. citizens reported to the Department of State as murdered in Mexico was 81 in 2013 and 100 in 2014.\nGun battles between rival criminal organizations or with Mexican authorities have taken place in towns and cities in many parts of Mexico, and have occurred in broad daylight on streets and in other public venues, such as restaurants and clubs. During some of these incidents, U.S. citizens have been temporarily prevented from leaving the area.\xa0Criminal organizations have used stolen cars, buses, and trucks to create roadblocks on major thoroughfares, preventing the military and police from responding to criminal activity. The location and timing of future armed engagements is unpredictable. We recommend that you defer travel to the areas specifically identified in this Travel Warning and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the other areas for which advisories are in effect.\nThe number of kidnappings throughout Mexico is of particular concern and appears to be on the rise. According to statistics published by the Mexican Secretaria de Gobernacion (SEGOB), in 2013 kidnappings nationwide increased 20 percent over the previous year. While kidnappings can occur anywhere, according to SEGOB, during this timeframe, the states with the highest numbers of kidnappings were Tamaulipas, Guerrero, Michoacán, Estado de Mexico, and Morelos. Additionally, according to a widely publicized study by the agency responsible for national statistics (INEGI, the National Institute of Statistics and Geography), Mexico suffered an estimated 105,682 kidnappings in 2012; only 1,317 were reported to the police. Police have been implicated in some of these incidents. Both local and expatriate communities have been victimized. More than 130 kidnappings of U.S. citizens were reported to the U.S. Embassy and consulates in Mexico between January and November of 2014.\nU.S. citizens are encouraged to lower their personal profiles and to avoid displaying indicators of wealth such as expensive-looking jewelry, watches, or cameras. U.S. citizens are encouraged to maintain awareness of their surroundings and avoid situations in which they may be isolated or stand out as potential victims.\nKidnappings in Mexico\xa0have included traditional, ""express,"" and ""virtual"" kidnappings. Victims of traditional kidnappings are physically abducted and held captive until a ransom is paid for release. ""Express"" kidnappings are those in which a victim is abducted for a short time and forced to withdraw money, usually from an ATM, then released. A ""virtual"" kidnapping is an\xa0extortion-by-deception scheme wherein a victim is contacted by phone and convinced to isolate themselves from\xa0family and friends until a ransom is paid. The victim is coerced (by threat of violence)\xa0to remain isolated and to provide phone numbers for the victim\'s family or\xa0loved ones. The victim\'s family is then contacted\xa0and a ransom for the ""kidnapped"" extracted. Recently, some travelers to Mexico staying at hotels as guests have been targets of such ""virtual""\xa0kidnapping schemes.\nOf particular safety concern are casinos, sports books, or other gambling establishments and adult entertainment establishments. U.S. government personnel are specifically prohibited from patronizing these establishments in the states of Coahuila, Durango, Zacatecas, Aguascalientes, San Luis Potosi, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, Jalisco, Colima and Nayarit.\nCarjacking and highway robbery are serious problems in many parts of the border region, and U.S. citizens have been murdered in such incidents. Most victims who complied with carjackers\' demands have reported that they were not physically harmed. Carjackers have shot at vehicles that have attempted to flee. Incidents have occurred during the day and at night, and carjackers have used a variety of techniques, including roadblocks, bumping/moving vehicles to force them to stop, and running vehicles off the road at high speeds. There are indications that criminals target newer and larger vehicles, especially dark-colored SUVs. However, even drivers of old sedans and buses coming from the United States have been targeted. While violent incidents can occur anywhere and at any time, they most frequently occur at night and on isolated roads. To reduce risk when traveling by road, we strongly urge you to travel between cities throughout Mexico only during daylight hours, to avoid isolated roads, and to use toll roads (""cuotas"") whenever possible.\nThe Mexican government has deployed federal police and military personnel throughout the country as part of its efforts to combat organized criminal groups. U.S. citizens traveling on Mexican roads and highways by car or bus may encounter government checkpoints, staffed by military or law enforcement personnel. In some places, criminal organizations have erected their own unauthorized checkpoints, at times wearing police and military uniforms, and have killed or abducted motorists who have failed to stop at them. You should cooperate at all checkpoints.\nDemonstrations are common and occur in all parts of the country. Even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence. Protesters in Mexico may block traffic on roads, including major thoroughfares, or take control of toll booths on highways. U.S. citizens are urged to avoid areas of demonstrations, and to exercise caution if in the vicinity of any protests. Travelers who encounter protestors demanding unofficial tolls are generally allowed to pass upon payment. Travelers are urged not to exit from major highways.\xa0U.S. Citizens should avoid participating in demonstrations and other activities that might be deemed political by the authorities as the Mexican Constitution prohibits political activities by foreigners; such actions may result in detention and/or deportation.\nThe Department imposes restrictions on U.S. government employees\' travel in Mexico. Since July 2010, USG employees are prohibited from driving on non-official travel from the U.S.-Mexico border to or from the interior of Mexico or Central America. Personal travel by motor vehicle is permitted during daylight hours on Highway 15 toll road between Hermosillo and Nogales, on Highway 45 between Ciudad Juarez and Chihuahua City, and on the main roads between Palomas, Chihuahua and Nuevo Casas Grandes, Chihuahua.\nU.S. government personnel and their families are prohibited from personal travel to all areas to which it is advised to ""defer non-essential travel.” When travel for official purposes is essential, it is conducted with extensive security precautions. U.S. government personnel and their families are allowed to travel for personal reasons to the areas where no advisory is in effect or where the advisory is to exercise caution. While the general public is not forbidden from visiting places categorized under ""defer non-essential travel,"" U.S. government personnel will not be able to respond quickly to an emergency situation in those areas due to security precautions that must be taken by U.S. government personnel to travel to those areas. Travel at night is prohibited for U.S. government personnel in some states as indicated below.\nFor more information on road safety and crime along Mexico\'s roadways, see the Department of State\'s\xa0Country Specific Information.\nState-by-State Assessment:\nBelow is a state-by-state assessment of security conditions throughout Mexico. Travelers should be mindful that even if no advisories are in effect for a given state, crime and violence can still occur. For general information about travel and other conditions in Mexico, see our\xa0Country Specific Information.\nAguascalientes:\xa0Exercise caution when traveling to the areas of the state that border the state of Zacatecas, as criminal organization activity in that region continues.\nBaja California:\xa0Tijuana, Rosarito, Ensenada and Mexicali are major cities/travel destinations in the state of Baja California\xa0-\xa0Exercise caution in the northern state of Baja California, particularly at night. Criminal activity along highways is a continuing security concern. According to the Baja State Secretariat for Public Security, from January to October 2014 Tijuana and Rosarito experienced increasing homicide rates compared to the same period in the previous year. While most of these homicides appeared to be targeted criminal organization assassinations, turf battles between criminal groups have resulted in violent crime in areas frequented by U.S. citizens. Shooting incidents, in which innocent bystanders have been injured, have occurred during daylight hours.\nBaja California Sur:\xa0Cabo San Lucas and La Paz are major cities/travel destinations in the state of Southern Baja California\xa0–\xa0Exercise caution in the state capital of La Paz. According to the Department of Interior of Mexico, in 2013 Baja California Sur registered its highest homicide rate since 1997. Many of these homicides occurred in La Paz, where there has been an increase in organized crime-related violence.\nCampeche:\xa0No advisory is in effect.\nChiapas:\xa0Palenque and San Cristobal de las Casas are major cities/travel destinations in Chiapas\xa0-\xa0No advisory is in effect.\nChihuahua:\xa0Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua City, and Copper Canyon are major cities/travel destinations in Chihuahua\xa0-\xa0Exercise caution in traveling to: the business and shopping districts in the northeast section of Ciudad Juarez and its major industrial parks, the central downtown section and major industrial parks in the city of Chihuahua, the town of Palomas, the urban area of the city of Ojinaga, and the towns of Nuevo Casas Grandes and Casas Grandes and their immediate environs.\xa0Travel to the Nuevo Casas Grandes area should be through the Palomas port of entry (POE) on U.S. Highway 11, continuing south until reaching Mexico Highway 2 west to Nuevo Casas Grandes. Travel to Ojinaga should be on the U.S. side via U.S. Highway 67 through the Presidio POE. Defer non-essential travel to other areas in the state of Chihuahua and travel between cities only on major highways and only during daylight hours. Crime and violence remain serious problems throughout the state of Chihuahua, particularly in the southern portion of the state and in the Sierra Mountains, including Copper Canyon.\nCoahuila:\xa0Defer non-essential travel to the state of Coahuila except the city of Saltillo, where you should exercise caution. Violence and criminal activity along the highways are continuing security concerns, particularly along the northern border between Piedras Negras and Nuevo Laredo. The state of Coahuila continues to experience high rates of violent crime, including murder, kidnapping, and armed carjacking.\nColima:\xa0Manzanillo is a major city/travel destination in Colima\xa0- Defer non-essential travel to the areas of the state of Colima that border the state of Michoacán, including the city of Tecoman. The security situation along the Michoacán border continues to be the most unstable in the state, and personal travel by U.S. government personnel is not permitted in this area.\nDurango:\xa0Exercise caution in the state of Durango. Violence and criminal activity along the highways are a continuing security concern. Several areas in the state continue to experience high rates of violence and remain volatile and unpredictable. U.S. government personnel may travel outside the city of Durango only during daylight hours on toll roads, and must return to the city of Durango to abide by a curfew of 1 a.m. to 6 a.m.\nEstado de Mexico:\xa0Toluca and Teotihuacan are major travel destinations in Estado de Mexico\xa0-\xa0Exercise caution in the State of Mexico. Many areas of the state have seen high levels of crime and insecurity as organized criminal groups have expanded their activities from the states of Guerrero and Michoacán, and have also experienced high levels of street crime. The September 2014\xa0INEGI crime victimization survey indicated that the State of Mexico had the highest incidence of crime in Mexico, with 47,778 victims\xa0per 100,000. Due to high rates of crime and insecurity, defer non-essential travel to the municipalities of Coacalco, Ecatepec, Nezahualcoyotl, La Paz, Valle del Chalco, Solidaridad, Chalco, and Ixtapaluca, which are eastern portions of the greater Mexico City metropolitan area, located just to the east of the Federal District of Mexico and Benito Juarez airport, unless traveling directly through the areas on major thoroughfares. Defer non-essential travel to the municipality of Tlatlaya in the southwest portion of the state and non-essential travel on any roads between Santa Marta in the southeast portion of the state and Huitzilac in the state of Morelos, including the Lagunas de Zempoala National Park and surrounding areas, due to high rates of crime and insecurity.\nGuanajuato: San Miguel de Allende and Leon are major cities/travel destinations in Guanajuato\xa0-\xa0No advisory is in effect.\nGuerrero: Acapulco, Ixtapa, Taxco and Zihuatanejo are major cities/travel destinations in Guerrero\xa0- Defer non-essential travel to all parts of the state, except for the cities of Acapulco, Ixtapa, and Zihuatanejo. Travel to Acapulco and Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo only by air or cruise ship, exercise caution, and remain in tourist areas. Travel in and out of Acapulco by air and cruise ship is permitted for U.S. government personnel. U.S. government personnel are prohibited from traveling within Guerrero state by land, including via the 95D toll road (“cuota”) to/from Mexico City and Acapulco, as well as highway 200 between Acapulco and Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo. In Acapulco, defer non-essential travel to areas further than two blocks inland of the Costera Miguel Aleman Boulevard, which parallels the popular beach areas. Lodging for U.S. government personnel is limited to the hotel zone (“zona hotelera”) of Acapulco, beginning from the Krystal Beach Acapulco hotel in the north and going south through Puerto Marquez, including the Playa Diamante area and ending at The Resort at Mundo Imperial hotel. In general, the popular tourist area of Diamante, just south of the city, has been less affected by violence. Any activity outside the hotel zone for U.S. government personnel is limited to the coastal area from La Quebrada to the beginning of the hotel zone and only during daylight hours. The state of Guerrero was the most violent state in Mexico in 2013, with 2,087 homicides and 207 reported cases of kidnapping, according to the Mexican Secretariado Ejecutivo Nacional de Seguridad Publica. Self-defense groups operate independently of the government in many areas of Guerrero. Armed members of these groups frequently maintain roadblocks and, although not considered hostile to foreigners or tourists, are suspicious of outsiders and should be considered volatile and unpredictable.\nHidalgo:\xa0No advisory is in effect.\nJalisco:\xa0Guadalajara, Puerto Vallarta, and Lake Chapala are major cities/travel destinations in Jalisco\xa0–\xa0Exercise caution throughout the state, particularly in rural areas and when using secondary highways. Violent clashes between criminal organizations and government authorities, and related disturbances including barricades of burning vehicles blocking major roads and highways, are ongoing concerns that typically occur without notice. Defer non-essential travel to areas of the state that border the states of Michoacán and Zacatecas. The security situation along the Michoacán and Zacatecas borders continues to be unstable. U.S. government personnel are authorized to use Federal toll road 15D for travel to Mexico City; however, they may not stop in the town of La Barca for any reason. U.S. government personnel are prohibited from personal travel to areas of Jalisco that border Zacatecas, and are prohibited from intercity travel at night.\nMexico City (also known as the Federal District):\xa0No advisory is in effect. See also the discussion in the section on Estado de Mexico for areas within the greater Mexico City metropolitan area.\nMichoacán:\xa0Morelia is a major city/travel destination in Michoacán\xa0- Defer non-essential travel to the state of Michoacán except the cities of Morelia and Lázaro Cardenas and the area north of federal toll road 15D, where you should exercise caution. U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling by land in Michoacán except on federal toll road 15D during daylight hours. Flying into Morelia and Lázaro Cardenas is the recommended method of travel. Attacks on Mexican government officials, law enforcement and military personnel, and other incidents of organized crime-related violence, have occurred throughout Michoacán. Armed members of some self-defense groups maintain roadblocks and, although not considered hostile to foreigners or tourists, are suspicious of outsiders and should be considered volatile and unpredictable. Some self-defense groups in Michoacán are reputed to be linked to organized crime.\nMorelos:\xa0Cuernavaca is a major city/travel destination in Morelos\xa0- Exercise caution in the state of Morelos due to the unpredictable nature of organized crime violence. You should also defer non-essential travel on any roads between Huitzilac in the northwest corner of the state and Santa Marta in the state of Mexico, including the Lagunas de Zempoala National Park and surrounding areas. Numerous incidents of organized crime-related violence have also occurred in the city of Cuernavaca.\nNayarit: The Riviera Nayarit coast, including the cities of Tepic, Xalisco, and San Blas, is a major travel destination in Nayarit\xa0-\xa0Defer non-essential travel to areas of the state of Nayarit that border the states of Sinaloa or Durango, as well as all rural areas and secondary highways.\nNuevo Leon: Monterrey is a major city/travel destination in Nuevo Leon\xa0– Exercise caution in the state of Nuevo Leon. Although the level of organized crime-related violence and general insecurity in Monterrey has decreased dramatically within the last two years, sporadic incidents of violence have occurred. Security services in and around Monterrey are robust and have proven responsive and effective in combating violent crimes; however, instances of violence remain a concern in the more remote regions of the state. U.S. government personnel and their dependents may travel outside the city of Monterrey only during daylight hours on toll roads, and must return to the city of San Pedro Garza Garcia municipal boundaries to abide by a curfew of 1 a.m. and 6 a.m., except for travel to the airport after 5 a.m.\nOaxaca: Oaxaca, Huatulco and Puerto Escondido are major cities/travel destinations in Oaxaca\xa0-\xa0No advisory is in effect.\nPuebla:\xa0No advisory is in effect.\nQueretaro:\xa0No advisory is in effect.\nQuintana Roo: Cancun, Cozumel, Playa del Carmen, Riviera Maya and Tulum are major cities/travel destinations in Quintana Roo\xa0- No advisory is in effect.\nSan Luis Potosi:\xa0Exercise caution in the state of San Luis Potosi. U.S. government personnel may travel outside the City of San Luis Potosi only during daylight hours on toll roads, and must return to the city of San Luis Potosi to abide by a curfew of 1 a.m. to 6 a.m.\nSinaloa: Mazatlan is a major city/travel destination in Sinaloa\xa0-\xa0Defer non-essential travel to the state of Sinaloa except the city of Mazatlan, where you should exercise caution, particularly late at night and in the early morning. One of Mexico\'s most powerful criminal organizations is based in the state of Sinaloa, and violent crime rates remain high in many parts of the state. Travel off the toll roads in remote areas of Sinaloa is especially dangerous and should be avoided. We recommend that any travel in Mazatlan be limited to Zona Dorada and the historic town center, as well as direct routes to/from these locations and the airport.\nSonora: Nogales, Puerto Peñasco, Hermosillo, and San Carlos are major cities/travel destinations in Sonora\xa0-\xa0Sonora is a key region in the international drug and human trafficking trades and can be extremely dangerous for travelers. Travelers throughout Sonora are encouraged to limit travel to main roads during daylight hours. The region west of Nogales, east of Sonoyta, and from Caborca north, including the towns of Saric, Tubutama, and Altar, and the eastern edge of Sonora bordering Chihuahua, are known centers of illegal activity, and non-essential travel between these cities should be avoided. Travelers should also defer non-essential travel to the eastern edge of the state of Sonora, which borders the state of Chihuahua (all points along that border east of the northern city of Agua Prieta and the southern town of Alamos), and defer non-essential travel within the city of Ciudad Obregon and south of the city of Navojoa. You should exercise caution while transiting Vicam in southern Sonora due to roadblocks that can be instituted\xa0ad hoc\xa0by local indigenous and environmental groups. U.S. citizens visiting Puerto Peñasco should use the Lukeville, Arizona/Sonoyta, Sonora border crossing, and limit driving to daylight hours.\nTabasco: Villahermosa is a major city/travel destination in Tabasco-\xa0No advisory is in effect.\nTamaulipas: Matamoros, Nuevo Laredo, Reynosa, and Tampico are major cities in Tamaulipas.\xa0Defer all non-essential travel to the state of Tamaulipas. Throughout the state violent crime, including homicide, armed robbery, carjacking, kidnapping, extortion, and sexual assault, pose significant safety risks. State and municipal law enforcement capacity is limited to nonexistent in many parts of Tamaulipas. Violent conflicts between rival criminal elements and/or the Mexican military can occur in all parts of the region and at all times of the day. Violent criminal activity occurs more frequently\xa0along the northern border. While no highway routes through Tamaulipas are considered safe, the highways between Matamoros-Ciudad Victoria, Reynosa-Ciudad Victoria, Ciudad Victoria-Tampico, Monterrey-Nuevo Laredo, Matamoros-Reynosa, and Monterrey-Reynosa, are more prone to criminal activity. Organized criminal groups sometimes target public and private passenger buses traveling through Tamaulipas. These groups sometimes take all passengers hostage and demand ransom payments. In Tamaulipas, U.S. government employees are subject to movement restrictions and a curfew between midnight and 6 a.m. Matamoros, Reynosa, Nuevo Laredo, and Ciudad Victoria have experienced numerous gun battles and attacks with explosive devices in the past year. The number of reported kidnappings in Tamaulipas is among the highest in Mexico, and the number of U.S. citizens reported to the consulates in Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo as being kidnapped, abducted, or disappearing involuntarily in 2014 has also increased.\nTlaxcala:\xa0No advisory is in effect.\nVeracruz:\xa0Exercise caution when traveling in the state of Veracruz. The state of Veracruz continues to experience violence among rival criminal organizations.\nYucatan:\xa0Merida and Chichen Itza are major cities/travel destinations in Yucatan\xa0-\xa0No advisory is in effect.\nZacatecas:\xa0Exercise caution in the state of Zacatecas. Robberies, carjackings, and organized criminal activity remain a concern. U.S. government personnel may travel outside the city of Zacatecas only during daylight hours on toll roads, and must return to the city of Zacatecas to abide by a curfew of 1 a.m. to 6 a.m.\nFurther Information\xa0For more detailed information on staying safe in Mexico, please see the State Department\'s\xa0Country Specific Information\xa0for Mexico.\nFor the latest security information, U.S. citizens traveling abroad should regularly monitor the\xa0State Department\'s internet web site, where the current\xa0Worldwide Caution,\xa0Travel Warnings, and\xa0Travel Alerts\xa0can be found.\xa0 Follow us on\xa0Twitter\xa0and the Bureau of\xa0Consular Affairs page on Facebook\xa0as well.\xa0 Up-to-date information on security can also be obtained by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll free in the United States and Canada or, for callers outside the United States and Canada, a regular toll line at 001-202-501-4444.\xa0 These numbers are available from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays).\xa0 U.S. citizens traveling or residing overseas are encouraged to enroll with the State Department\'s\xa0Smart Traveler Enrollment Program.\xa0 For any emergencies involving U.S. citizens in Mexico, please contact the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate with responsibility for that person\'s location in Mexico.\xa0 For information on the ten U.S. consular districts in Mexico, complete with links to Embassy and Consulate websites, please consult the Mexico U.S. Consular District\xa0map. \xa0The numbers provided below for the Embassy and Consulates are available around the clock.\xa0 The U.S. Embassy is located in Mexico City at Paseo de la Reforma 305, Colonia Cuauhtemoc, telephone from the United States: 011-52-55-5080-2000; telephone within Mexico City: 5080-2000; telephone long distance within Mexico 01-55-5080-2000.\xa0U.S. citizens may also contact the Embassy by\xa0e-mail.\nConsulates (with consular districts):\nConsular Agencies:'}","[{'link': 'http://www.travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/mexico.html', 'title': 'Country Specific Information'}, {'link': 'http://www.travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/mexico.html', 'title': 'Country Specific Information'}, {'link': 'http://www.travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/country/mexico.html', 'title': 'Country Specific Information'}, {'link': 'http://www.travel.state.gov/', 'title': ""State Department's internet web site""}, {'link': 'http://www.travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/worldwide-caution.html', 'title': 'Worldwide Caution'}, {'link': 'http://www.travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings.html', 'title': 'Travel Warnings, and\xa0Travel Alerts'}, {'link': 'http://www.twitter.com/travelgov', 'title': 'Twitter'}, {'link': 'https://www.facebook.com/travelgov?fref=ts', 'title': 'Consular Affairs page on Facebook'}, {'link': 'https://step.state.gov/step/', 'title': 'Smart Traveler Enrollment Program'}, {'link': 'http://mexico.usembassy.gov/eng/citizen_services/consular-district-map.html', 'title': 'map'}, {'link': 'mailto://travel.state.gov/ACSMexicoCity@state.gov', 'title': 'e-mail'}]","2015-12-09 23:25:10","2015-12-09 23:25:10"

All consular services, routine and/or emergency, have been suspended until further notice. The Department urges U.S. citizens to defer travel to Yemen and those U.S. citizens currently living in Yemen to depart when you are able to safely do so. This supersedes the Travel Warning for Yemen issued on February 11, 2015.\nThe level of instability and ongoing threats in Yemen remain severe.\xa0 There are no plans for a U.S. government-coordinated evacuation of U.S. citizens at this time. We encourage all U.S. citizens to shelter in a secure location until they are able to depart safely. U.S. citizens wishing to depart should do so via commercial transportation options when they become available. Keep vital records and travel documents close at hand; U.S. citizens should be prepared to depart at a moment’s notice.\xa0 The airports are currently closed, but may open unexpectedly; other unforeseen opportunities to depart may also suddenly arise.\nAdditionally, some foreign governments may arrange transportation for their nationals and may be willing to offer assistance to others.\xa0 There is no guarantee that foreign governments will assist U.S. citizens in leaving Yemen.\xa0 U.S. citizens who choose to seek foreign government assistance in leaving Yemen should only do so if they can safely make their way to the point of embarkation and have received confirmation that there is space available.\xa0 Even if assured there is space aboard transportation, U.S. citizens should be aware that there is no guarantee that they will be permitted to board the transport, or may have to wait an indefinite period until they can do so. \xa0There is also no guarantee of where travelers will go. For U.S. citizen inquiries, you may send an email to YEMENEMERGENCYUSC@state.gov.\nTerrorist organizations, including Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), continue to be active throughout Yemen. The U.S. government remains extremely concerned about possible attacks on U.S. citizens (whether visiting or residing in Yemen), and U.S. facilities, businesses, and perceived U.S. and Western interests. In addition, piracy in the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Indian Ocean is a security threat to maritime activities in the region. See our International Maritime Piracy Fact Sheet.\nThe U.S. government is concerned about the risks to civil aircraft operating in Yemen’s Sanaa Flight Information Region (FIR) due to ongoing military operations, political instability, and violence from competing armed groups involved in combat operations and other military-related activity associated with the unrest. The fighting and instability spans a large area of Yemen, which creates a significant risk to the safe operation of U.S. civil aviation.\xa0 FAA prohibits U.S. civil flight operations in the Sanaa FIR, which includes the entire country of Yemen and extends into adjacent international airspace, at all altitudes.\nFor further background information regarding FAA flight prohibitions and advisories for U.S. civil aviation, U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices.\nU.S. citizens remaining in Yemen despite this Travel Warning should limit nonessential travel within the country, make their own contingency emergency plans, enroll their presence in Yemen through the\xa0Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP), and provide their current contact information and next-of-kin or emergency contact information.

"http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/israel-travel-warning.html","Israel, The West Bank and Gaza Travel Warning","2015-02-18 22:27:00","IS","{'value': 'The security environment remains complex in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza, and U.S. citizens need to be aware of the continuing risks of travel to these areas, particularly to areas described in this Travel Warning where there are heightened tensions and security risks.\nThe security situation can change day to day, depending on the political situation, recent events, and geographic area. A rise in political tensions and violence in Jerusalem and the West Bank has resulted in injuries to and deaths of U.S. citizens. In view of the ongoing security situation, the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority make considerable efforts to police major tourist attractions and ensure security in areas where foreigners frequently travel. Although threat mitigation efforts by authorities are not 100 percent effective, hundreds of thousands of U.S. citizens safely visit Israel and the West Bank each year for study, tourism, and business.\nThe Department of State strongly warns U.S. citizens against travel to the Gaza Strip; U.S. government employees are not allowed to conduct official or personal travel there. U.S. government personnel require special security arrangements if traveling inside Israel within seven kilometers of the Gaza demarcation line. With the exception of Jericho and Bethlehem, U.S. government employees are prohibited from personal travel to the West Bank. Due to security concerns, U.S. government employees are prohibited from using public buses throughout Israel and the West Bank, and must obtain advance approval if they wish to travel within 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) of the Lebanon border, or travel on or east of Route 98 in the Golan Heights. U.S. citizens should take into consideration the following information, including the rules governing travel in this region by U.S. government employees. This replaces the Travel Warning issued September 10, 2014.\nMajor Metropolitan Areas\nPersonal safety conditions in major metropolitan areas, including Tel Aviv and Haifa and surrounding regions, are comparable to other major global cities. Nonetheless, the July-August 2014 Gaza conflict (see below) and subsequent political and religious tension associated with access to the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem led to increased levels of violence, particularly in Jerusalem and West Bank environs, not seen in those areas in a decade. Attacks on individuals and groups have occurred in East and West Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Bethlehem, as well as various places in the West Bank. We have no indication that U.S. citizens have been specifically targeted based on their nationality, however U.S. citizens have been directly affected. Six U.S. citizen residents of Israel and the West Bank were killed and others injured in multiple attacks in 2014. U.S. citizens involved in or observing political demonstrations have sustained serious injuries and the Department of State recommends that U.S. citizens avoid all demonstrations for their own\xa0safety. Due to security concerns, U.S. government employees are prohibited from using public buses in Israel and the West Bank. See below for specific safety and security information regarding Gaza, the West Bank, Jerusalem, and near Israel’s northern borders.\nTravelers should be aware of the risks presented by the potential for military conflict between Hamas and Israel. During the conflict in Gaza in July and August 2014, long-range rockets launched from Gaza reached many locations in Israel and the West Bank – including Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and other cities in the north and south. The Government of Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system successfully intercepted many rockets. However, missile impacts also caused deaths, injuries, and property damage. There have been additional small arms fire and mortar and rocket launches from Gaza into southern Israel on several occasions between September and December 2014 that resulted in limited property damage.\nVisitors to and residents of Israel and the West Bank should familiarize themselves with the location of the nearest bomb shelter or other hardened site.\xa0Consult municipality websites, such as those for\xa0Jerusalem\xa0and\xa0Tel Aviv, for locations of public bomb shelters and other emergency preparedness information. Visitors should seek information on shelters from hotel staff or building managers. We advise all U.S. citizens to take note of guidance on proper procedures in the event of rocket attacks or other crisis events by visiting the website of the government of Israel\'s\xa0Home Front Command.\nTravelers should also be aware of the heightened state of alert maintained by Israeli authorities along Israel\'s border with Egypt. There have been cross-border incidents from Egypt, including rocket attacks and ground incursions, such as attacks that took place in August 2013, January 20 and October 22, 2014. Rockets and mortars were launched from Sinai in the direction of Eilat and Israel’s Negev region in January, July, and August 2014.\nVisitors should observe appropriate personal security practices to reduce their vulnerability to crime, particularly late at night or in isolated areas, including in the countryside. Visitors are advised to avoid large gatherings or demonstrations and keep current with local news, which is available through numerous English language sources.\nJerusalem\nU.S. citizens visiting and living in Jerusalem should be aware of the numerous political, cultural, and religious tensions that permeate the city. These sensitivities have the potential to fuel protests, civil unrest, acts of terrorism, and retaliatory attacks against groups and individuals. There have been frequent clashes between protesters and Israeli authorities, particularly in East Jerusalem neighborhoods. Travelers should be aware that protest activities and violence have occurred across Jerusalem, including in West Jerusalem, within the Old City, and in East Jerusalem neighborhoods such as Sheikh Jarrah, Shufat, Beit Hanina, Mt. of Olives, As Suwaneh, Abu Deis, Silwan, Shuafat Refugee Camp, Issawiyeh, and Tsur Baher. The intensity and number of these violent events, which have caused the deaths of bystanders, remained at high levels during October and November. Such events often increase following Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif access restrictions, in retaliation for random attacks, or during Israel National Police (INP) operations in predominantly Palestinian neighborhoods. The INP often deploys a heavy presence in many of the neighborhoods that have seen clashes and may restrict vehicular traffic to some of these neighborhoods without notice. U.S. citizens are advised not to enter any neighborhoods while restricted by the INP and to avoid any locations with active clashes.\nTo date, the clashes and violence have not been anti-American in nature. However, politically motivated violence in Jerusalem claimed the lives of U.S. citizens in October and November 2014, including a terror attack inside a synagogue. Other U.S. citizens have also been injured in such attacks. Travelers are reminded to exercise caution at Muslim religious sites on Fridays and on holy days, particularly during the holy month of Ramadan. The INP often imposes restrictions on visitors to the Old City’s Temple Mount/ Haram al-Sharif. Travelers should be aware that the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif is often closed without warning by the INP. U.S. government employees are prohibited from entering the Old City on Fridays during Ramadan due to congestion and security-related access restrictions.\nU.S. citizens are advised to avoid public parks in Jerusalem after dark, due to numerous reports of criminal activity associated with these parks.\nNorthern Israel\xa0and Golan Heights\nRocket attacks into Israel from Lebanon have occurred without warning along the Israeli-Lebanese border. Tensions have increased along portions of the Disengagement Zone with Syria in the Golan Heights as a result of the internal conflict occurring in Syria. Sporadic gunfire has occurred along the border region. There have been several incidents of mortar shells and light arms fire impacting on the Israeli-controlled side of the zone as a result of spillover from the fighting in Syria. Travelers should be aware that cross-border gunfire can occur without warning. Furthermore, there are active land mines in areas of the Golan Heights, so visitors should walk only on established roads or trails. The Syrian conflict is sporadic and unpredictable. Because of concerns about security on Israel’s northern borders, U.S. government personnel must obtain advance approval if they wish to travel within 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) of the Lebanon border, or travel on or east of Route 98 in the Golan Heights.\nThe West Bank\nThe Department of State urges U.S. citizens to exercise caution when traveling to the West Bank. In October 2014, a U.S. citizen teenager was killed in an encounter with Israeli security forces in Silwad, and in June 2014, three Israeli teenagers, including a dual U.S. citizen, were kidnapped and murdered by Hamas-affiliated individuals while hitchhiking near Hebron. Demonstrations and violent incidents can occur without warning, and vehicles are sometimes damaged by rocks, Molotov cocktails, and gunfire on West Bank roads. U.S citizens have been killed in such attacks in the past. There have also been an increasing number of violent incidents involving Israeli settlers and Palestinian villagers in the corridor stretching from Ramallah to Nablus, including attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinian villages in which U.S. citizens have suffered injury or property damage, as well as attacks by Palestinians on settlements. U.S. citizens can be caught in the middle of potentially dangerous situations, and some U.S. citizens involved in political demonstrations in the West Bank have sustained serious injuries. The Department of State recommends that U.S. citizens avoid all demonstrations for their own safety. During periods of unrest, the Israeli government may restrict access to the West Bank, and some areas may be placed under curfew. All persons in areas under curfew should remain indoors to avoid arrest or injury. Security conditions in the West Bank may hinder the ability of U.S. government officials to offer timely assistance to U.S. citizens.\nPersonal travel in the West Bank by U.S. government personnel and their families is permitted to the towns of Bethlehem and Jericho and on Routes 1, 443, and 90 after completing certain security procedures. The Rachel’s Tomb checkpoint between Jerusalem and Bethlehem has seen an increase in public demonstrations, which have the potential to become violent. U.S. government officials may also engage in personal travel to Qumran off Route 90 by the Dead Sea and to the Allenby Bridge crossing to Jordan, as well as stops at roadside facilities along Routes 1 and 90. All other personal travel by U.S. government personnel in the West Bank is prohibited. U.S. government personnel routinely travel to the West Bank for official business, but do so with special security arrangements.\nThe Gaza Strip\nThe Department of State strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid all travel to the Gaza Strip, which is under the control of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization. U.S. citizens in Gaza are advised to depart immediately. U.S. government U.S. citizen employees are not allowed to travel to Gaza, in either personal or professional capacities. U.S. government travel within seven kilometers of the Gaza demarcation requires special security arrangements. The security environment within Gaza, including its border with Egypt and its seacoast, is dangerous and volatile. Exchanges of fire between the Israel Defense Forces and militant groups in Gaza take place regularly, and civilians have been caught in the crossfire in the past. Since late October 2014, Egyptian authorities have closed the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt for extended periods with no indication regarding when it will reopen for normal traffic. When operating, the Rafah crossing normally allows for some passenger travel, however, prior coordination with local authorities - which could take days or weeks to process - may be required and crossing points may be closed for days or weeks. Travelers who enter the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing must also exit through the Rafah crossing, and those entering the Gaza Strip may not be able to depart at a time of their choosing. Many U.S. citizens have been unable to exit Gaza or faced lengthy delays while attempting to exit Gaza. Furthermore, the schedule and requirements for exiting through the Rafah crossing are unpredictable and can involve significant expense. The ability of U.S. government personnel to offer timely assistance to U.S. citizens, including assistance departing Gaza, is extremely limited. The Consulate General and Embassy are often unable to assist U.S. citizens to exit Gaza via the Erez crossing to Israel. U.S. citizens who choose to travel to Gaza cannot normally rely on the U.S. government to assist them in departing Gaza.\nEntry/Exit Difficulties\nSome U.S. citizens holding Israeli nationality, possessing a Palestinian identity card, or who are of Arab or Muslim origin have experienced significant difficulties in entering or exiting Israel or the West Bank. U.S. citizens planning to travel to Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza should consult the detailed information concerning entry and exit difficulties in the\xa0Country Specific Information.\nU.S. citizens seeking to depart Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza are responsible for making their own travel arrangements. The lack of a valid U.S. passport may hinder U.S. citizens\' ability to depart the country and may slow the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General\'s ability to provide assistance.\nTravelers should check the status of border crossings before embarking on trips.\nContact the\xa0Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy\xa0for information and assistance in Israel, the Golan Heights, and ports of entry at Ben Gurion Airport, Haifa Port, the northern (Jordan River/Sheikh Hussein) and southern (Arava) border crossings connecting Israel and Jordan, and the border crossings between Israel and Egypt. An embassy officer can be contacted at (972) (3) 519-7575 from Monday through Friday during working hours. The after-hours emergency number is (972) (3) 519-7551.\nContact the\xa0Consular Section of the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem\xa0for information and assistance in Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and the Allenby/King Hussein Bridge crossing between the West Bank and Jordan, at (972) (2) 630-4000 from Monday through Friday during working hours. The after-hours emergency number is (972) (2) 622-7250.\nFor More Information\nThe Department of State urges those U.S. citizens who live in or travel to Israel, the West Bank or Gaza to enroll in the Department of State’s\xa0Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)\xa0in order to obtain the most current information on travel and security within Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. Enrollment in STEP makes it easier for the Embassy or Consulate General to contact U.S. citizens in case of emergency.

"http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/mauritania-travel-warning.html","Mauritania Travel Warning","2014-10-08 02:39:00","MR","{'value': ""The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the risks of traveling to Mauritania, and urges those who travel to Mauritania to exercise extreme caution because of activities by terrorist groups in the region, including al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).\nAQIM continues to demonstrate its intent and ability to conduct attacks against foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens.\xa0 This replaces the travel warning for Mauritania, issued March 12, 2014, to update information on security incidents and remind travelers of security concerns.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Nouakchott recommends against all non-essential travel to the border regions of Guidimagha, the Hodh El Charghi and Hodh El Gharbi regions of southeastern Mauritania, the eastern half of the Assaba region (east of Kiffa), Tidjikja, the eastern half of the Tagant region (east of Tidjika), the eastern half of the Adrar region (east of chinguetti), and the Zemmour region of northern Mauritania because of the security risk and the threat of kidnapping posed by terrorist groups to foreign nationals.\nThe United States and the European Union have both declared AQIM a terrorist organization.\xa0 As a result of Western involvement in counterterrorism efforts, AQIM has declared its intention to attack Western targets.\xa0 AQIM attempts at retaliatory attacks against western targets of opportunity cannot be discounted.\xa0 AQIM-affiliated support systems for logistics and recruitment remain present in Mauritania.\nAQIM and terrorists believed to be affiliated with AQIM have been operating in Mauritania since at least 2005.\xa0 Actions include kidnapping and murder of western tourists, aid workers, and Mauritanian soldiers, as well as attacks on foreign diplomatic missions in Mauritania.\xa0 In June 2009, AQIM-affiliated operatives murdered a private U.S. citizen in the capital city of Nouakchott in an attempted kidnapping.\nSince then, AQIM has continued to threaten Westerners.\xa0 A French citizen was kidnapped in southwest Mali, near the border with Mauritania, in November 2012.\xa0 In the past, AQIM has also focused on gendarme military installations and personnel by conducting suicide bomber attacks, attempting car bombing, and kidnappings of a Mauritanian gendarme.\nAs a result of safety and security concerns, some NGOs and private aid organizations withdrew staff and/or temporarily suspended operations in Mauritania.\xa0 The Peace Corps officially closed its program in July 2011.\xa0 Faith-based organizations operating in Mauritania, or individuals perceived to be proselytizing, may be particularly targeted.\nU.S. citizens should remain aware of their surroundings at all times and maintain good personal security practices, including always locking their homes and cars, varying routes and times of travel, and maintaining a low profile by not drawing attention to themselves.\xa0 When going out, they should avoid being part of large, highly visible groups of Westerners, and refrain from sitting in areas that are easily visible from the street when in restaurants or cafes.\xa0 U.S. citizens should be particularly alert when frequenting locales associated with Westerners, including grocery stores, hotels, cultural centers, social and recreation clubs, beach areas, and restaurants.\xa0 Additionally, U.S. citizens should avoid demonstrations and highly publicized events/venues with no visible security presence.\nU.S. citizens driving in Mauritania are reminded to heed warnings to stop at security checkpoints, and should be particularly vigilant when traveling by road outside of populated areas, even when traveling along main routes and highways.\xa0 U.S. citizens should not venture outside urban areas unless in a convoy and accompanied by an experienced guide, and even then only if equipped with sturdy vehicles and ample provisions, including redundant communications, as well as vehicle and first aid/medical supplies.\xa0 Driving after dark outside of urban areas is strongly discouraged.\xa0 There have been reports of banditry and smuggling in the more remote parts of Mauritania.\xa0 Note also that landmines remain a danger along the border with the Western Sahara.\xa0 Travelers should cross borders only at designated border posts.\nThe U.S. embassy strongly encourages U.S. citizens who travel to or remain in Mauritania despite this travel warning to enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP).\xa0 By enrolling in STEP, you will receive the most up-to-date security information, and make it easier to contact you in an emergency.\xa0 Please keep all of your information in STEP current.\xa0 It is important when enrolling or updating information to include multiple phone numbers and email addresses to facilitate communication in the event of an emergency.\nFor information on general crime and security issues, U.S. citizens should also consult the department of state's Country Specific Information for Mauritania, the Worldwide Caution, and the International Maritime Piracy Fact Sheet, which are located on the Department of State's website.\xa0 Travelers may obtain up-to-date information on security conditions by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the United States and Canada or on a regular toll line at 1-202-501-4444 from other countries.\xa0 Stay up to date by bookmarking our Bureau of Consular Affairs website, which contains current travel warnings and travel alerts.\xa0 Follow us on Twitter and the bureau of consular affairs page on Facebook as well.\nThe U.S. embassy is located between the presidency building and the Spanish Embassy on Rue Abdallaye.\xa0 The postal address is B.P. 222, Nouakchott, telephone (222) 4-525-2660/2663, 4-525-1141/1145, or 4-525-3038, and fax (222) 4-525-1592.\xa0 For after-hours emergencies, please call (222) 4-525-3288 or visit the U.S. Embassy Nouakchott web site.\xa0 In the event of an emergency that interrupts mobile phone (SMS) or internet communication in Mauritania, U.S. citizens may call the embassy's dedicated consular emergency recording at (222) 4-525-3701 to receive the most up-to-date instructions.""}","[{'link':
